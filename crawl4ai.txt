Crawl4AI is the #1 trending GitHub repository, actively maintained by a vibrant community. It delivers blazing-fast, AI-ready web crawling tailored for large language models, AI agents, and data pipelines. Fully open source, flexible, and built for real-time performance, Crawl4AI empowers developers with unmatched speed, precision, and deployment ease.

Note: If you're looking for the old documentation, you can access it here.

Quick Start
Here's a quick example to show you how easy it is to use Crawl4AI with its asynchronous capabilities:

import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler

async def main():
    # Create an instance of AsyncWebCrawler
    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        # Run the crawler on a URL
        result = await crawler.arun(url="https://crawl4ai.com")

        # Print the extracted content
        print(result.markdown)

# Run the async main function
asyncio.run(main())
What Does Crawl4AI Do?
Crawl4AI is a feature-rich crawler and scraper that aims to:

1. Generate Clean Markdown: Perfect for RAG pipelines or direct ingestion into LLMs.
2. Structured Extraction: Parse repeated patterns with CSS, XPath, or LLM-based extraction.
3. Advanced Browser Control: Hooks, proxies, stealth modes, session re-use—fine-grained control.
4. High Performance: Parallel crawling, chunk-based extraction, real-time use cases.
5. Open Source: No forced API keys, no paywalls—everyone can access their data.

Core Philosophies: - Democratize Data: Free to use, transparent, and highly configurable.
- LLM Friendly: Minimally processed, well-structured text, images, and metadata, so AI models can easily consume it.

Installation & Setup (2023 Edition)
1. Basic Installation
pip install crawl4ai
This installs the core Crawl4AI library along with essential dependencies. No advanced features (like transformers or PyTorch) are included yet.

2. Initial Setup & Diagnostics
2.1 Run the Setup Command
After installing, call:

crawl4ai-setup
What does it do? - Installs or updates required Playwright browsers (Chromium, Firefox, etc.) - Performs OS-level checks (e.g., missing libs on Linux) - Confirms your environment is ready to crawl

2.2 Diagnostics
Optionally, you can run diagnostics to confirm everything is functioning:

crawl4ai-doctor
This command attempts to: - Check Python version compatibility - Verify Playwright installation - Inspect environment variables or library conflicts

If any issues arise, follow its suggestions (e.g., installing additional system packages) and re-run crawl4ai-setup.

3. Verifying Installation: A Simple Crawl (Skip this step if you already run crawl4ai-doctor)
Below is a minimal Python script demonstrating a basic crawl. It uses our new BrowserConfig and CrawlerRunConfig for clarity, though no custom settings are passed in this example:

import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, BrowserConfig, CrawlerRunConfig

async def main():
    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(
            url="https://www.example.com",
        )
        print(result.markdown[:300])  # Show the first 300 characters of extracted text

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Expected outcome: - A headless browser session loads example.com - Crawl4AI returns ~300 characters of markdown.
If errors occur, rerun crawl4ai-doctor or manually ensure Playwright is installed correctly.

4. Advanced Installation (Optional)
Warning: Only install these if you truly need them. They bring in larger dependencies, including big models, which can increase disk usage and memory load significantly.

4.1 Torch, Transformers, or All
Text Clustering (Torch)

pip install crawl4ai[torch]
crawl4ai-setup
Installs PyTorch-based features (e.g., cosine similarity or advanced semantic chunking).
Transformers

pip install crawl4ai[transformer]
crawl4ai-setup
Adds Hugging Face-based summarization or generation strategies.
All Features

pip install crawl4ai[all]
crawl4ai-setup
(Optional) Pre-Fetching Models
crawl4ai-download-models
This step caches large models locally (if needed). Only do this if your workflow requires them.
5. Docker (Experimental)
We provide a temporary Docker approach for testing. It’s not stable and may break with future releases. We plan a major Docker revamp in a future stable version, 2025 Q1. If you still want to try:

docker pull unclecode/crawl4ai:basic
docker run -p 11235:11235 unclecode/crawl4ai:basic
You can then make POST requests to http://localhost:11235/crawl to perform crawls. Production usage is discouraged until our new Docker approach is ready (planned in Jan or Feb 2025).

6. Local Server Mode (Legacy)
Some older docs mention running Crawl4AI as a local server. This approach has been partially replaced by the new Docker-based prototype and upcoming stable server release. You can experiment, but expect major changes. Official local server instructions will arrive once the new Docker architecture is finalized.

Summary
1. Install with pip install crawl4ai and run crawl4ai-setup. 2. Diagnose with crawl4ai-doctor if you see errors. 3. Verify by crawling example.com with minimal BrowserConfig + CrawlerRunConfig. 4. Advanced features (Torch, Transformers) are optional—avoid them if you don’t need them (they significantly increase resource usage). 5. Docker is experimental—use at your own risk until the stable version is released. 6. Local server references in older docs are largely deprecated; a new solution is in progress.

Docker Deployment
Crawl4AI provides official Docker images for easy deployment and scalability. This guide covers installation, configuration, and usage of Crawl4AI in Docker environments.

Quick Start 🚀
Pull and run the basic version:

# Basic run without security
docker pull unclecode/crawl4ai:basic
docker run -p 11235:11235 unclecode/crawl4ai:basic

# Run with API security enabled
docker run -p 11235:11235 -e CRAWL4AI_API_TOKEN=your_secret_token unclecode/crawl4ai:basic
Running with Docker Compose 🐳
Use Docker Compose (From Local Dockerfile or Docker Hub)
Crawl4AI provides flexibility to use Docker Compose for managing your containerized services. You can either build the image locally from the provided Dockerfile or use the pre-built image from Docker Hub.

Option 1: Using Docker Compose to Build Locally
If you want to build the image locally, use the provided docker-compose.local.yml file.

docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up -d
This will: 1. Build the Docker image from the provided Dockerfile. 2. Start the container and expose it on http://localhost:11235.

Option 2: Using Docker Compose with Pre-Built Image from Hub
If you prefer using the pre-built image on Docker Hub, use the docker-compose.hub.yml file.

docker-compose -f docker-compose.hub.yml up -d
This will: 1. Pull the pre-built image unclecode/crawl4ai:basic (or all, depending on your configuration). 2. Start the container and expose it on http://localhost:11235.

Stopping the Running Services
To stop the services started via Docker Compose, you can use:

docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml down
# OR
docker-compose -f docker-compose.hub.yml down
If the containers don’t stop and the application is still running, check the running containers:

docker ps
Find the CONTAINER ID of the running service and stop it forcefully:

docker stop <CONTAINER_ID>
Debugging with Docker Compose
Check Logs: To view the container logs:

docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml logs -f
Remove Orphaned Containers: If the service is still running unexpectedly:

docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml down --remove-orphans
Manually Remove Network: If the network is still in use:

docker network ls
docker network rm crawl4ai_default
Why Use Docker Compose?
Docker Compose is the recommended way to deploy Crawl4AI because: 1. It simplifies multi-container setups. 2. Allows you to define environment variables, resources, and ports in a single file. 3. Makes it easier to switch between local development and production-ready images.

For example, your docker-compose.yml could include API keys, token settings, and memory limits, making deployment quick and consistent.

API Security 🔒
Understanding CRAWL4AI_API_TOKEN
The CRAWL4AI_API_TOKEN provides optional security for your Crawl4AI instance:

If CRAWL4AI_API_TOKEN is set: All API endpoints (except /health) require authentication
If CRAWL4AI_API_TOKEN is not set: The API is publicly accessible
# Secured Instance
docker run -p 11235:11235 -e CRAWL4AI_API_TOKEN=your_secret_token unclecode/crawl4ai:all

# Unsecured Instance
docker run -p 11235:11235 unclecode/crawl4ai:all
Making API Calls
For secured instances, include the token in all requests:

import requests

# Setup headers if token is being used
api_token = "your_secret_token"  # Same token set in CRAWL4AI_API_TOKEN
headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {api_token}"} if api_token else {}

# Making authenticated requests
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:11235/crawl",
    headers=headers,
    json={
        "urls": "https://example.com",
        "priority": 10
    }
)

# Checking task status
task_id = response.json()["task_id"]
status = requests.get(
    f"http://localhost:11235/task/{task_id}",
    headers=headers
)
Using with Docker Compose
In your docker-compose.yml:

services:
  crawl4ai:
    image: unclecode/crawl4ai:all
    environment:
      - CRAWL4AI_API_TOKEN=${CRAWL4AI_API_TOKEN:-}  # Optional
    # ... other configuration
Then either: 1. Set in .env file:

CRAWL4AI_API_TOKEN=your_secret_token
Or set via command line:
CRAWL4AI_API_TOKEN=your_secret_token docker-compose up
Security Note: If you enable the API token, make sure to keep it secure and never commit it to version control. The token will be required for all API endpoints except the health check endpoint (/health).

Configuration Options 🔧
Environment Variables
You can configure the service using environment variables:

# Basic configuration
docker run -p 11235:11235 \
    -e MAX_CONCURRENT_TASKS=5 \
    unclecode/crawl4ai:all

# With security and LLM support
docker run -p 11235:11235 \
    -e CRAWL4AI_API_TOKEN=your_secret_token \
    -e OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... \
    -e ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-... \
    unclecode/crawl4ai:all
Using Docker Compose (Recommended) 🐳
Create a docker-compose.yml:

version: '3.8'

services:
  crawl4ai:
    image: unclecode/crawl4ai:all
    ports:
      - "11235:11235"
    environment:
      - CRAWL4AI_API_TOKEN=${CRAWL4AI_API_TOKEN:-}  # Optional API security
      - MAX_CONCURRENT_TASKS=5
      # LLM Provider Keys
      - OPENAI_API_KEY=${OPENAI_API_KEY:-}
      - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY:-}
    volumes:
      - /dev/shm:/dev/shm
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          memory: 4G
        reservations:
          memory: 1G
You can run it in two ways:

Using environment variables directly:

CRAWL4AI_API_TOKEN=secret123 OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... docker-compose up
Using a .env file (recommended): Create a .env file in the same directory:

# API Security (optional)
CRAWL4AI_API_TOKEN=your_secret_token

# LLM Provider Keys
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...

# Other Configuration
MAX_CONCURRENT_TASKS=5
Then simply run:

docker-compose up
Testing the Deployment 🧪
import requests

# For unsecured instances
def test_unsecured():
    # Health check
    health = requests.get("http://localhost:11235/health")
    print("Health check:", health.json())

    # Basic crawl
    response = requests.post(
        "http://localhost:11235/crawl",
        json={
            "urls": "https://www.nbcnews.com/business",
            "priority": 10
        }
    )
    task_id = response.json()["task_id"]
    print("Task ID:", task_id)

# For secured instances
def test_secured(api_token):
    headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {api_token}"}

    # Basic crawl with authentication
    response = requests.post(
        "http://localhost:11235/crawl",
        headers=headers,
        json={
            "urls": "https://www.nbcnews.com/business",
            "priority": 10
        }
    )
    task_id = response.json()["task_id"]
    print("Task ID:", task_id)
LLM Extraction Example 🤖
When you've configured your LLM provider keys (via environment variables or .env), you can use LLM extraction:

request = {
    "urls": "https://example.com",
    "extraction_config": {
        "type": "llm",
        "params": {
            "provider": "openai/gpt-4",
            "instruction": "Extract main topics from the page"
        }
    }
}

# Make the request (add headers if using API security)
response = requests.post("http://localhost:11235/crawl", json=request)
Note: Remember to add .env to your .gitignore to keep your API keys secure!

Getting Started with Crawl4AI
Welcome to Crawl4AI, an open-source LLM-friendly Web Crawler & Scraper. In this tutorial, you’ll:

Run your first crawl using minimal configuration.
Generate Markdown output (and learn how it’s influenced by content filters).
Experiment with a simple CSS-based extraction strategy.
See a glimpse of LLM-based extraction (including open-source and closed-source model options).
Crawl a dynamic page that loads content via JavaScript.
1. Introduction
Crawl4AI provides:

An asynchronous crawler, AsyncWebCrawler.
Configurable browser and run settings via BrowserConfig and CrawlerRunConfig.
Automatic HTML-to-Markdown conversion via DefaultMarkdownGenerator (supports optional filters).
Multiple extraction strategies (LLM-based or “traditional” CSS/XPath-based).
By the end of this guide, you’ll have performed a basic crawl, generated Markdown, tried out two extraction strategies, and crawled a dynamic page that uses “Load More” buttons or JavaScript updates.

2. Your First Crawl
Here’s a minimal Python script that creates an AsyncWebCrawler, fetches a webpage, and prints the first 300 characters of its Markdown output:

import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler

async def main():
    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun("https://example.com")
        print(result.markdown[:300])  # Print first 300 chars

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
What’s happening? - AsyncWebCrawler launches a headless browser (Chromium by default). - It fetches https://example.com. - Crawl4AI automatically converts the HTML into Markdown.

You now have a simple, working crawl!

3. Basic Configuration (Light Introduction)
Crawl4AI’s crawler can be heavily customized using two main classes:

1. BrowserConfig: Controls browser behavior (headless or full UI, user agent, JavaScript toggles, etc.).
2. CrawlerRunConfig: Controls how each crawl runs (caching, extraction, timeouts, hooking, etc.).

Below is an example with minimal usage:

import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, BrowserConfig, CrawlerRunConfig, CacheMode

async def main():
    browser_conf = BrowserConfig(headless=True)  # or False to see the browser
    run_conf = CrawlerRunConfig(
        cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS
    )

    async with AsyncWebCrawler(config=browser_conf) as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(
            url="https://example.com",
            config=run_conf
        )
        print(result.markdown)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
IMPORTANT: By default cache mode is set to CacheMode.ENABLED. So to have fresh content, you need to set it to CacheMode.BYPASS

We’ll explore more advanced config in later tutorials (like enabling proxies, PDF output, multi-tab sessions, etc.). For now, just note how you pass these objects to manage crawling.

4. Generating Markdown Output
By default, Crawl4AI automatically generates Markdown from each crawled page. However, the exact output depends on whether you specify a markdown generator or content filter.

result.markdown:
The direct HTML-to-Markdown conversion.
result.markdown.fit_markdown:
The same content after applying any configured content filter (e.g., PruningContentFilter).
Example: Using a Filter with DefaultMarkdownGenerator
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig
from crawl4ai.content_filter_strategy import PruningContentFilter
from crawl4ai.markdown_generation_strategy import DefaultMarkdownGenerator

md_generator = DefaultMarkdownGenerator(
    content_filter=PruningContentFilter(threshold=0.4, threshold_type="fixed")
)

config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS,
    markdown_generator=md_generator
)

async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
    result = await crawler.arun("https://news.ycombinator.com", config=config)
    print("Raw Markdown length:", len(result.markdown.raw_markdown))
    print("Fit Markdown length:", len(result.markdown.fit_markdown))
Note: If you do not specify a content filter or markdown generator, you’ll typically see only the raw Markdown. PruningContentFilter may adds around 50ms in processing time. We’ll dive deeper into these strategies in a dedicated Markdown Generation tutorial.

5. Simple Data Extraction (CSS-based)
Crawl4AI can also extract structured data (JSON) using CSS or XPath selectors. Below is a minimal CSS-based example:

New! Crawl4AI now provides a powerful utility to automatically generate extraction schemas using LLM. This is a one-time cost that gives you a reusable schema for fast, LLM-free extractions:

from crawl4ai.extraction_strategy import JsonCssExtractionStrategy

# Generate a schema (one-time cost)
html = "<div class='product'><h2>Gaming Laptop</h2><span class='price'>$999.99</span></div>"

# Using OpenAI (requires API token)
schema = JsonCssExtractionStrategy.generate_schema(
    html,
    llm_provider="openai/gpt-4o",  # Default provider
    api_token="your-openai-token"  # Required for OpenAI
)

# Or using Ollama (open source, no token needed)
schema = JsonCssExtractionStrategy.generate_schema(
    html,
    llm_provider="ollama/llama3.3",  # Open source alternative
    api_token=None  # Not needed for Ollama
)

# Use the schema for fast, repeated extractions
strategy = JsonCssExtractionStrategy(schema)
For a complete guide on schema generation and advanced usage, see No-LLM Extraction Strategies.

Here's a basic extraction example:

import asyncio
import json
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig, CacheMode
from crawl4ai.extraction_strategy import JsonCssExtractionStrategy

async def main():
    schema = {
        "name": "Example Items",
        "baseSelector": "div.item",
        "fields": [
            {"name": "title", "selector": "h2", "type": "text"},
            {"name": "link", "selector": "a", "type": "attribute", "attribute": "href"}
        ]
    }

    raw_html = "<div class='item'><h2>Item 1</h2><a href='https://example.com/item1'>Link 1</a></div>"

    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(
            url="raw://" + raw_html,
            config=CrawlerRunConfig(
                cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS,
                extraction_strategy=JsonCssExtractionStrategy(schema)
            )
        )
        # The JSON output is stored in 'extracted_content'
        data = json.loads(result.extracted_content)
        print(data)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Why is this helpful? - Great for repetitive page structures (e.g., item listings, articles). - No AI usage or costs. - The crawler returns a JSON string you can parse or store.

Tips: You can pass raw HTML to the crawler instead of a URL. To do so, prefix the HTML with raw://.

6. Simple Data Extraction (LLM-based)
For more complex or irregular pages, a language model can parse text intelligently into a structure you define. Crawl4AI supports open-source or closed-source providers:

Open-Source Models (e.g., ollama/llama3.3, no_token)
OpenAI Models (e.g., openai/gpt-4, requires api_token)
Or any provider supported by the underlying library
Below is an example using open-source style (no token) and closed-source:

import os
import json
import asyncio
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig
from crawl4ai.extraction_strategy import LLMExtractionStrategy

class OpenAIModelFee(BaseModel):
    model_name: str = Field(..., description="Name of the OpenAI model.")
    input_fee: str = Field(..., description="Fee for input token for the OpenAI model.")
    output_fee: str = Field(
        ..., description="Fee for output token for the OpenAI model."
    )

async def extract_structured_data_using_llm(
    provider: str, api_token: str = None, extra_headers: Dict[str, str] = None
):
    print(f"\n--- Extracting Structured Data with {provider} ---")

    if api_token is None and provider != "ollama":
        print(f"API token is required for {provider}. Skipping this example.")
        return

    browser_config = BrowserConfig(headless=True)

    extra_args = {"temperature": 0, "top_p": 0.9, "max_tokens": 2000}
    if extra_headers:
        extra_args["extra_headers"] = extra_headers

    crawler_config = CrawlerRunConfig(
        cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS,
        word_count_threshold=1,
        page_timeout=80000,
        extraction_strategy=LLMExtractionStrategy(
            provider=provider,
            api_token=api_token,
            schema=OpenAIModelFee.model_json_schema(),
            extraction_type="schema",
            instruction="""From the crawled content, extract all mentioned model names along with their fees for input and output tokens. 
            Do not miss any models in the entire content.""",
            extra_args=extra_args,
        ),
    )

    async with AsyncWebCrawler(config=browser_config) as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(
            url="https://openai.com/api/pricing/", config=crawler_config
        )
        print(result.extracted_content)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Use ollama with llama3.3
    # asyncio.run(
    #     extract_structured_data_using_llm(
    #         provider="ollama/llama3.3", api_token="no-token"
    #     )
    # )

    asyncio.run(
        extract_structured_data_using_llm(
            provider="openai/gpt-4o", api_token=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
        )
    )
What’s happening? - We define a Pydantic schema (PricingInfo) describing the fields we want. - The LLM extraction strategy uses that schema and your instructions to transform raw text into structured JSON. - Depending on the provider and api_token, you can use local models or a remote API.

7. Multi-URL Concurrency (Preview)
If you need to crawl multiple URLs in parallel, you can use arun_many(). By default, Crawl4AI employs a MemoryAdaptiveDispatcher, automatically adjusting concurrency based on system resources. Here’s a quick glimpse:

import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig, CacheMode

async def quick_parallel_example():
    urls = [
        "https://example.com/page1",
        "https://example.com/page2",
        "https://example.com/page3"
    ]

    run_conf = CrawlerRunConfig(
        cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS,
        stream=True  # Enable streaming mode
    )

    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        # Stream results as they complete
        async for result in await crawler.arun_many(urls, config=run_conf):
            if result.success:
                print(f"[OK] {result.url}, length: {len(result.markdown_v2.raw_markdown)}")
            else:
                print(f"[ERROR] {result.url} => {result.error_message}")

        # Or get all results at once (default behavior)
        run_conf = run_conf.clone(stream=False)
        results = await crawler.arun_many(urls, config=run_conf)
        for res in results:
            if res.success:
                print(f"[OK] {res.url}, length: {len(res.markdown_v2.raw_markdown)}")
            else:
                print(f"[ERROR] {res.url} => {res.error_message}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(quick_parallel_example())
The example above shows two ways to handle multiple URLs: 1. Streaming mode (stream=True): Process results as they become available using async for 2. Batch mode (stream=False): Wait for all results to complete

For more advanced concurrency (e.g., a semaphore-based approach, adaptive memory usage throttling, or customized rate limiting), see Advanced Multi-URL Crawling.

8. Dynamic Content Example
Some sites require multiple “page clicks” or dynamic JavaScript updates. Below is an example showing how to click a “Next Page” button and wait for new commits to load on GitHub, using BrowserConfig and CrawlerRunConfig:

import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, BrowserConfig, CrawlerRunConfig, CacheMode
from crawl4ai.extraction_strategy import JsonCssExtractionStrategy

async def extract_structured_data_using_css_extractor():
    print("\n--- Using JsonCssExtractionStrategy for Fast Structured Output ---")
    schema = {
        "name": "KidoCode Courses",
        "baseSelector": "section.charge-methodology .w-tab-content > div",
        "fields": [
            {
                "name": "section_title",
                "selector": "h3.heading-50",
                "type": "text",
            },
            {
                "name": "section_description",
                "selector": ".charge-content",
                "type": "text",
            },
            {
                "name": "course_name",
                "selector": ".text-block-93",
                "type": "text",
            },
            {
                "name": "course_description",
                "selector": ".course-content-text",
                "type": "text",
            },
            {
                "name": "course_icon",
                "selector": ".image-92",
                "type": "attribute",
                "attribute": "src",
            },
        ],
    }

    browser_config = BrowserConfig(headless=True, java_script_enabled=True)

    js_click_tabs = """
    (async () => {
        const tabs = document.querySelectorAll("section.charge-methodology .tabs-menu-3 > div");
        for(let tab of tabs) {
            tab.scrollIntoView();
            tab.click();
            await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 500));
        }
    })();
    """

    crawler_config = CrawlerRunConfig(
        cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS,
        extraction_strategy=JsonCssExtractionStrategy(schema),
        js_code=[js_click_tabs],
    )

    async with AsyncWebCrawler(config=browser_config) as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(
            url="https://www.kidocode.com/degrees/technology", config=crawler_config
        )

        companies = json.loads(result.extracted_content)
        print(f"Successfully extracted {len(companies)} companies")
        print(json.dumps(companies[0], indent=2))

async def main():
    await extract_structured_data_using_css_extractor()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Key Points:

BrowserConfig(headless=False): We want to watch it click “Next Page.”
CrawlerRunConfig(...): We specify the extraction strategy, pass session_id to reuse the same page.
js_code and wait_for are used for subsequent pages (page > 0) to click the “Next” button and wait for new commits to load.
js_only=True indicates we’re not re-navigating but continuing the existing session.
Finally, we call kill_session() to clean up the page and browser session.

Simple Crawling
This guide covers the basics of web crawling with Crawl4AI. You'll learn how to set up a crawler, make your first request, and understand the response.

Basic Usage
Set up a simple crawl using BrowserConfig and CrawlerRunConfig:

import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler
from crawl4ai.async_configs import BrowserConfig, CrawlerRunConfig

async def main():
    browser_config = BrowserConfig()  # Default browser configuration
    run_config = CrawlerRunConfig()   # Default crawl run configuration

    async with AsyncWebCrawler(config=browser_config) as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(
            url="https://example.com",
            config=run_config
        )
        print(result.markdown)  # Print clean markdown content

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Understanding the Response
The arun() method returns a CrawlResult object with several useful properties. Here's a quick overview (see CrawlResult for complete details):

result = await crawler.arun(
    url="https://example.com",
    config=CrawlerRunConfig(fit_markdown=True)
)

# Different content formats
print(result.html)         # Raw HTML
print(result.cleaned_html) # Cleaned HTML
print(result.markdown)     # Markdown version
print(result.fit_markdown) # Most relevant content in markdown

# Check success status
print(result.success)      # True if crawl succeeded
print(result.status_code)  # HTTP status code (e.g., 200, 404)

# Access extracted media and links
print(result.media)        # Dictionary of found media (images, videos, audio)
print(result.links)        # Dictionary of internal and external links
Adding Basic Options
Customize your crawl using CrawlerRunConfig:

run_config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    word_count_threshold=10,        # Minimum words per content block
    exclude_external_links=True,    # Remove external links
    remove_overlay_elements=True,   # Remove popups/modals
    process_iframes=True           # Process iframe content
)

result = await crawler.arun(
    url="https://example.com",
    config=run_config
)
Handling Errors
Always check if the crawl was successful:

run_config = CrawlerRunConfig()
result = await crawler.arun(url="https://example.com", config=run_config)

if not result.success:
    print(f"Crawl failed: {result.error_message}")
    print(f"Status code: {result.status_code}")
Logging and Debugging
Enable verbose logging in BrowserConfig:

browser_config = BrowserConfig(verbose=True)

async with AsyncWebCrawler(config=browser_config) as crawler:
    run_config = CrawlerRunConfig()
    result = await crawler.arun(url="https://example.com", config=run_config)
Complete Example
Here's a more comprehensive example demonstrating common usage patterns:

import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler
from crawl4ai.async_configs import BrowserConfig, CrawlerRunConfig, CacheMode

async def main():
    browser_config = BrowserConfig(verbose=True)
    run_config = CrawlerRunConfig(
        # Content filtering
        word_count_threshold=10,
        excluded_tags=['form', 'header'],
        exclude_external_links=True,

        # Content processing
        process_iframes=True,
        remove_overlay_elements=True,

        # Cache control
        cache_mode=CacheMode.ENABLED  # Use cache if available
    )

    async with AsyncWebCrawler(config=browser_config) as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(
            url="https://example.com",
            config=run_config
        )

        if result.success:
            # Print clean content
            print("Content:", result.markdown[:500])  # First 500 chars

            # Process images
            for image in result.media["images"]:
                print(f"Found image: {image['src']}")

            # Process links
            for link in result.links["internal"]:
                print(f"Internal link: {link['href']}")

        else:
            print(f"Crawl failed: {result.error_message}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Crawl Result and Output
When you call arun() on a page, Crawl4AI returns a CrawlResult object containing everything you might need—raw HTML, a cleaned version, optional screenshots or PDFs, structured extraction results, and more. This document explains those fields and how they map to different output types.

1. The CrawlResult Model
Below is the core schema. Each field captures a different aspect of the crawl’s result:

class MarkdownGenerationResult(BaseModel):
    raw_markdown: str
    markdown_with_citations: str
    references_markdown: str
    fit_markdown: Optional[str] = None
    fit_html: Optional[str] = None

class CrawlResult(BaseModel):
    url: str
    html: str
    success: bool
    cleaned_html: Optional[str] = None
    media: Dict[str, List[Dict]] = {}
    links: Dict[str, List[Dict]] = {}
    downloaded_files: Optional[List[str]] = None
    screenshot: Optional[str] = None
    pdf : Optional[bytes] = None
    markdown: Optional[Union[str, MarkdownGenerationResult]] = None
    markdown_v2: Optional[MarkdownGenerationResult] = None
    extracted_content: Optional[str] = None
    metadata: Optional[dict] = None
    error_message: Optional[str] = None
    session_id: Optional[str] = None
    response_headers: Optional[dict] = None
    status_code: Optional[int] = None
    ssl_certificate: Optional[SSLCertificate] = None
    class Config:
        arbitrary_types_allowed = True
Table: Key Fields in CrawlResult
Field (Name & Type)	Description
url (str)	The final or actual URL crawled (in case of redirects).
html (str)	Original, unmodified page HTML. Good for debugging or custom processing.
success (bool)	True if the crawl completed without major errors, else False.
cleaned_html (Optional[str])	Sanitized HTML with scripts/styles removed; can exclude tags if configured via excluded_tags etc.
media (Dict[str, List[Dict]])	Extracted media info (images, audio, etc.), each with attributes like src, alt, score, etc.
links (Dict[str, List[Dict]])	Extracted link data, split by internal and external. Each link usually has href, text, etc.
downloaded_files (Optional[List[str]])	If accept_downloads=True in BrowserConfig, this lists the filepaths of saved downloads.
screenshot (Optional[str])	Screenshot of the page (base64-encoded) if screenshot=True.
pdf (Optional[bytes])	PDF of the page if pdf=True.
markdown (Optional[str or MarkdownGenerationResult])	For now, markdown_v2 holds a MarkdownGenerationResult. Over time, this will be consolidated into markdown. The generator can provide raw markdown, citations, references, and optionally fit_markdown.
markdown_v2 (Optional[MarkdownGenerationResult])	Legacy field for detailed markdown output. This will be replaced by markdown soon.
extracted_content (Optional[str])	The output of a structured extraction (CSS/LLM-based) stored as JSON string or other text.
metadata (Optional[dict])	Additional info about the crawl or extracted data.
error_message (Optional[str])	If success=False, contains a short description of what went wrong.
session_id (Optional[str])	The ID of the session used for multi-page or persistent crawling.
response_headers (Optional[dict])	HTTP response headers, if captured.
status_code (Optional[int])	HTTP status code (e.g., 200 for OK).
ssl_certificate (Optional[SSLCertificate])	SSL certificate info if fetch_ssl_certificate=True.
2. HTML Variants
html: Raw HTML
Crawl4AI preserves the exact HTML as result.html. Useful for:

Debugging page issues or checking the original content.
Performing your own specialized parse if needed.
cleaned_html: Sanitized
If you specify any cleanup or exclusion parameters in CrawlerRunConfig (like excluded_tags, remove_forms, etc.), you’ll see the result here:

config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    excluded_tags=["form", "header", "footer"],
    keep_data_attributes=False
)
result = await crawler.arun("https://example.com", config=config)
print(result.cleaned_html)  # Freed of forms, header, footer, data-* attributes
3. Markdown Generation
3.1 markdown_v2 (Legacy) vs markdown
markdown_v2: The current location for detailed markdown output, returning a MarkdownGenerationResult object.
markdown: Eventually, we’re merging these fields. For now, you might see result.markdown_v2 used widely in code examples.
MarkdownGenerationResult Fields:

Field	Description
raw_markdown	The basic HTML→Markdown conversion.
markdown_with_citations	Markdown including inline citations that reference links at the end.
references_markdown	The references/citations themselves (if citations=True).
fit_markdown	The filtered/“fit” markdown if a content filter was used.
fit_html	The filtered HTML that generated fit_markdown.
3.2 Basic Example with a Markdown Generator
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig
from crawl4ai.markdown_generation_strategy import DefaultMarkdownGenerator

config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    markdown_generator=DefaultMarkdownGenerator(
        options={"citations": True, "body_width": 80}  # e.g. pass html2text style options
    )
)
result = await crawler.arun(url="https://example.com", config=config)

md_res = result.markdown_v2  # or eventually 'result.markdown'
print(md_res.raw_markdown[:500])
print(md_res.markdown_with_citations)
print(md_res.references_markdown)
Note: If you use a filter like PruningContentFilter, you’ll get fit_markdown and fit_html as well.

4. Structured Extraction: extracted_content
If you run a JSON-based extraction strategy (CSS, XPath, LLM, etc.), the structured data is not stored in markdown—it’s placed in result.extracted_content as a JSON string (or sometimes plain text).

Example: CSS Extraction with raw:// HTML
import asyncio
import json
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig, CacheMode
from crawl4ai.extraction_strategy import JsonCssExtractionStrategy

async def main():
    schema = {
        "name": "Example Items",
        "baseSelector": "div.item",
        "fields": [
            {"name": "title", "selector": "h2", "type": "text"},
            {"name": "link", "selector": "a", "type": "attribute", "attribute": "href"}
        ]
    }
    raw_html = "<div class='item'><h2>Item 1</h2><a href='https://example.com/item1'>Link 1</a></div>"

    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(
            url="raw://" + raw_html,
            config=CrawlerRunConfig(
                cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS,
                extraction_strategy=JsonCssExtractionStrategy(schema)
            )
        )
        data = json.loads(result.extracted_content)
        print(data)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Here: - url="raw://..." passes the HTML content directly, no network requests.
- The CSS extraction strategy populates result.extracted_content with the JSON array [{"title": "...", "link": "..."}].

5. More Fields: Links, Media, and More
5.1 links
A dictionary, typically with "internal" and "external" lists. Each entry might have href, text, title, etc. This is automatically captured if you haven’t disabled link extraction.

print(result.links["internal"][:3])  # Show first 3 internal links
5.2 media
Similarly, a dictionary with "images", "audio", "video", etc. Each item could include src, alt, score, and more, if your crawler is set to gather them.

images = result.media.get("images", [])
for img in images:
    print("Image URL:", img["src"], "Alt:", img.get("alt"))
5.3 screenshot and pdf
If you set screenshot=True or pdf=True in CrawlerRunConfig, then:

result.screenshot contains a base64-encoded PNG string.
result.pdf contains raw PDF bytes (you can write them to a file).
with open("page.pdf", "wb") as f:
    f.write(result.pdf)
5.4 ssl_certificate
If fetch_ssl_certificate=True, result.ssl_certificate holds details about the site’s SSL cert, such as issuer, validity dates, etc.

6. Accessing These Fields
After you run:

result = await crawler.arun(url="https://example.com", config=some_config)
Check any field:

if result.success:
    print(result.status_code, result.response_headers)
    print("Links found:", len(result.links.get("internal", [])))
    if result.markdown_v2:
        print("Markdown snippet:", result.markdown_v2.raw_markdown[:200])
    if result.extracted_content:
        print("Structured JSON:", result.extracted_content)
else:
    print("Error:", result.error_message)
Remember: Use result.markdown_v2 for now. It will eventually become result.markdown.

Browser & Crawler Configuration (Quick Overview)
Crawl4AI’s flexibility stems from two key classes:

1. BrowserConfig – Dictates how the browser is launched and behaves (e.g., headless or visible, proxy, user agent).
2. CrawlerRunConfig – Dictates how each crawl operates (e.g., caching, extraction, timeouts, JavaScript code to run, etc.).

In most examples, you create one BrowserConfig for the entire crawler session, then pass a fresh or re-used CrawlerRunConfig whenever you call arun(). This tutorial shows the most commonly used parameters. If you need advanced or rarely used fields, see the Configuration Parameters.

1. BrowserConfig Essentials
class BrowserConfig:
    def __init__(
        browser_type="chromium",
        headless=True,
        proxy_config=None,
        viewport_width=1080,
        viewport_height=600,
        verbose=True,
        use_persistent_context=False,
        user_data_dir=None,
        cookies=None,
        headers=None,
        user_agent=None,
        text_mode=False,
        light_mode=False,
        extra_args=None,
        # ... other advanced parameters omitted here
    ):
        ...
Key Fields to Note
1. browser_type
- Options: "chromium", "firefox", or "webkit".
- Defaults to "chromium".
- If you need a different engine, specify it here.

2. headless
- True: Runs the browser in headless mode (invisible browser).
- False: Runs the browser in visible mode, which helps with debugging.

3. proxy_config
- A dictionary with fields like:

{
    "server": "http://proxy.example.com:8080", 
    "username": "...", 
    "password": "..."
}
- Leave as None if a proxy is not required.
4. viewport_width & viewport_height:
- The initial window size.
- Some sites behave differently with smaller or bigger viewports.

5. verbose:
- If True, prints extra logs.
- Handy for debugging.

6. use_persistent_context:
- If True, uses a persistent browser profile, storing cookies/local storage across runs.
- Typically also set user_data_dir to point to a folder.

7. cookies & headers:
- If you want to start with specific cookies or add universal HTTP headers, set them here.
- E.g. cookies=[{"name": "session", "value": "abc123", "domain": "example.com"}].

8. user_agent:
- Custom User-Agent string. If None, a default is used.
- You can also set user_agent_mode="random" for randomization (if you want to fight bot detection).

9. text_mode & light_mode:
- text_mode=True disables images, possibly speeding up text-only crawls.
- light_mode=True turns off certain background features for performance.

10. extra_args:
- Additional flags for the underlying browser.
- E.g. ["--disable-extensions"].

Helper Methods
Both configuration classes provide a clone() method to create modified copies:

# Create a base browser config
base_browser = BrowserConfig(
    browser_type="chromium",
    headless=True,
    text_mode=True
)

# Create a visible browser config for debugging
debug_browser = base_browser.clone(
    headless=False,
    verbose=True
)
Minimal Example:

from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, BrowserConfig

browser_conf = BrowserConfig(
    browser_type="firefox",
    headless=False,
    text_mode=True
)

async with AsyncWebCrawler(config=browser_conf) as crawler:
    result = await crawler.arun("https://example.com")
    print(result.markdown[:300])
2. CrawlerRunConfig Essentials
class CrawlerRunConfig:
    def __init__(
        word_count_threshold=200,
        extraction_strategy=None,
        markdown_generator=None,
        cache_mode=None,
        js_code=None,
        wait_for=None,
        screenshot=False,
        pdf=False,
        enable_rate_limiting=False,
        rate_limit_config=None,
        memory_threshold_percent=70.0,
        check_interval=1.0,
        max_session_permit=20,
        display_mode=None,
        verbose=True,
        stream=False,  # Enable streaming for arun_many()
        # ... other advanced parameters omitted
    ):
        ...
Key Fields to Note
1. word_count_threshold:
- The minimum word count before a block is considered.
- If your site has lots of short paragraphs or items, you can lower it.

2. extraction_strategy:
- Where you plug in JSON-based extraction (CSS, LLM, etc.).
- If None, no structured extraction is done (only raw/cleaned HTML + markdown).

3. markdown_generator:
- E.g., DefaultMarkdownGenerator(...), controlling how HTML→Markdown conversion is done.
- If None, a default approach is used.

4. cache_mode:
- Controls caching behavior (ENABLED, BYPASS, DISABLED, etc.).
- If None, defaults to some level of caching or you can specify CacheMode.ENABLED.

5. js_code:
- A string or list of JS strings to execute.
- Great for “Load More” buttons or user interactions.

6. wait_for:
- A CSS or JS expression to wait for before extracting content.
- Common usage: wait_for="css:.main-loaded" or wait_for="js:() => window.loaded === true".

7. screenshot & pdf:
- If True, captures a screenshot or PDF after the page is fully loaded.
- The results go to result.screenshot (base64) or result.pdf (bytes).

8. verbose:
- Logs additional runtime details.
- Overlaps with the browser’s verbosity if also set to True in BrowserConfig.

9. enable_rate_limiting:
- If True, enables rate limiting for batch processing.
- Requires rate_limit_config to be set.

10. rate_limit_config:
- A RateLimitConfig object controlling rate limiting behavior.
- See below for details.

11. memory_threshold_percent:
- The memory threshold (as a percentage) to monitor.
- If exceeded, the crawler will pause or slow down.

12. check_interval:
- The interval (in seconds) to check system resources.
- Affects how often memory and CPU usage are monitored.

13. max_session_permit:
- The maximum number of concurrent crawl sessions.
- Helps prevent overwhelming the system.

14. display_mode:
- The display mode for progress information (DETAILED, BRIEF, etc.).
- Affects how much information is printed during the crawl.

Helper Methods
The clone() method is particularly useful for creating variations of your crawler configuration:

# Create a base configuration
base_config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    cache_mode=CacheMode.ENABLED,
    word_count_threshold=200,
    wait_until="networkidle"
)

# Create variations for different use cases
stream_config = base_config.clone(
    stream=True,  # Enable streaming mode
    cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS
)

debug_config = base_config.clone(
    page_timeout=120000,  # Longer timeout for debugging
    verbose=True
)
The clone() method: - Creates a new instance with all the same settings - Updates only the specified parameters - Leaves the original configuration unchanged - Perfect for creating variations without repeating all parameters

Rate Limiting & Resource Management
For batch processing with arun_many(), you can enable intelligent rate limiting:

from crawl4ai import RateLimitConfig

config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    enable_rate_limiting=True,
    rate_limit_config=RateLimitConfig(
        base_delay=(1.0, 3.0),    # Random delay range
        max_delay=60.0,           # Max delay after rate limits
        max_retries=3,            # Retries before giving up
        rate_limit_codes=[429, 503]  # Status codes to watch
    ),
    memory_threshold_percent=70.0,  # Memory threshold
    check_interval=1.0,            # Resource check interval
    max_session_permit=20,         # Max concurrent crawls
    display_mode="DETAILED"        # Progress display mode
)
This configuration: - Implements intelligent rate limiting per domain - Monitors system resources - Provides detailed progress information - Manages concurrent crawls efficiently

Minimal Example:

from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig

crawl_conf = CrawlerRunConfig(
    js_code="document.querySelector('button#loadMore')?.click()",
    wait_for="css:.loaded-content",
    screenshot=True,
    enable_rate_limiting=True,
    rate_limit_config=RateLimitConfig(
        base_delay=(1.0, 3.0),
        max_delay=60.0,
        max_retries=3,
        rate_limit_codes=[429, 503]
    ),
    stream=True  # Enable streaming
)

async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
    result = await crawler.arun(url="https://example.com", config=crawl_conf)
    print(result.screenshot[:100])  # Base64-encoded PNG snippet
3. Putting It All Together
In a typical scenario, you define one BrowserConfig for your crawler session, then create one or more CrawlerRunConfig depending on each call’s needs:

import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, BrowserConfig, CrawlerRunConfig, CacheMode
from crawl4ai.extraction_strategy import JsonCssExtractionStrategy

async def main():
    # 1) Browser config: headless, bigger viewport, no proxy
    browser_conf = BrowserConfig(
        headless=True,
        viewport_width=1280,
        viewport_height=720
    )

    # 2) Example extraction strategy
    schema = {
        "name": "Articles",
        "baseSelector": "div.article",
        "fields": [
            {"name": "title", "selector": "h2", "type": "text"},
            {"name": "link", "selector": "a", "type": "attribute", "attribute": "href"}
        ]
    }
    extraction = JsonCssExtractionStrategy(schema)

    # 3) Crawler run config: skip cache, use extraction
    run_conf = CrawlerRunConfig(
        extraction_strategy=extraction,
        cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS,
        enable_rate_limiting=True,
        rate_limit_config=RateLimitConfig(
            base_delay=(1.0, 3.0),
            max_delay=60.0,
            max_retries=3,
            rate_limit_codes=[429, 503]
        )
    )

    async with AsyncWebCrawler(config=browser_conf) as crawler:
        # 4) Execute the crawl
        result = await crawler.arun(url="https://example.com/news", config=run_conf)

        if result.success:
            print("Extracted content:", result.extracted_content)
        else:
            print("Error:", result.error_message)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
4. Next Steps
For a detailed list of available parameters (including advanced ones), see:

BrowserConfig and CrawlerRunConfig Reference
You can explore topics like:

Custom Hooks & Auth (Inject JavaScript or handle login forms).
Session Management (Re-use pages, preserve state across multiple calls).
Magic Mode or Identity-based Crawling (Fight bot detection by simulating user behavior).
Advanced Caching (Fine-tune read/write cache modes).
5. Conclusion
BrowserConfig and CrawlerRunConfig give you straightforward ways to define:

Which browser to launch, how it should run, and any proxy or user agent needs.
How each crawl should behave—caching, timeouts, JavaScript code, extraction strategies, etc.
Use them together for clear, maintainable code, and when you need more specialized behavior, check out the advanced parameters in the reference docs. Happy crawling!
Markdown Generation Basics
One of Crawl4AI’s core features is generating clean, structured markdown from web pages. Originally built to solve the problem of extracting only the “actual” content and discarding boilerplate or noise, Crawl4AI’s markdown system remains one of its biggest draws for AI workflows.

In this tutorial, you’ll learn:

How to configure the Default Markdown Generator
How content filters (BM25 or Pruning) help you refine markdown and discard junk
The difference between raw markdown (result.markdown) and filtered markdown (fit_markdown)
Prerequisites
- You’ve completed or read AsyncWebCrawler Basics to understand how to run a simple crawl.
- You know how to configure CrawlerRunConfig.

1. Quick Example
Here’s a minimal code snippet that uses the DefaultMarkdownGenerator with no additional filtering:

import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig
from crawl4ai.markdown_generation_strategy import DefaultMarkdownGenerator

async def main():
    config = CrawlerRunConfig(
        markdown_generator=DefaultMarkdownGenerator()
    )
    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun("https://example.com", config=config)

        if result.success:
            print("Raw Markdown Output:\n")
            print(result.markdown)  # The unfiltered markdown from the page
        else:
            print("Crawl failed:", result.error_message)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
What’s happening?
- CrawlerRunConfig( markdown_generator = DefaultMarkdownGenerator() ) instructs Crawl4AI to convert the final HTML into markdown at the end of each crawl.
- The resulting markdown is accessible via result.markdown.

2. How Markdown Generation Works
2.1 HTML-to-Text Conversion (Forked & Modified)
Under the hood, DefaultMarkdownGenerator uses a specialized HTML-to-text approach that:

Preserves headings, code blocks, bullet points, etc.
Removes extraneous tags (scripts, styles) that don’t add meaningful content.
Can optionally generate references for links or skip them altogether.
A set of options (passed as a dict) allows you to customize precisely how HTML converts to markdown. These map to standard html2text-like configuration plus your own enhancements (e.g., ignoring internal links, preserving certain tags verbatim, or adjusting line widths).

2.2 Link Citations & References
By default, the generator can convert <a href="..."> elements into [text][1] citations, then place the actual links at the bottom of the document. This is handy for research workflows that demand references in a structured manner.

2.3 Optional Content Filters
Before or after the HTML-to-Markdown step, you can apply a content filter (like BM25 or Pruning) to reduce noise and produce a “fit_markdown”—a heavily pruned version focusing on the page’s main text. We’ll cover these filters shortly.

3. Configuring the Default Markdown Generator
You can tweak the output by passing an options dict to DefaultMarkdownGenerator. For example:

from crawl4ai.markdown_generation_strategy import DefaultMarkdownGenerator
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig

async def main():
    # Example: ignore all links, don't escape HTML, and wrap text at 80 characters
    md_generator = DefaultMarkdownGenerator(
        options={
            "ignore_links": True,
            "escape_html": False,
            "body_width": 80
        }
    )

    config = CrawlerRunConfig(
        markdown_generator=md_generator
    )

    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun("https://example.com/docs", config=config)
        if result.success:
            print("Markdown:\n", result.markdown[:500])  # Just a snippet
        else:
            print("Crawl failed:", result.error_message)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import asyncio
    asyncio.run(main())
Some commonly used options:

ignore_links (bool): Whether to remove all hyperlinks in the final markdown.
ignore_images (bool): Remove all ![image]() references.
escape_html (bool): Turn HTML entities into text (default is often True).
body_width (int): Wrap text at N characters. 0 or None means no wrapping.
skip_internal_links (bool): If True, omit #localAnchors or internal links referencing the same page.
include_sup_sub (bool): Attempt to handle <sup> / <sub> in a more readable way.
4. Content Filters
Content filters selectively remove or rank sections of text before turning them into Markdown. This is especially helpful if your page has ads, nav bars, or other clutter you don’t want.

4.1 BM25ContentFilter
If you have a search query, BM25 is a good choice:

from crawl4ai.markdown_generation_strategy import DefaultMarkdownGenerator
from crawl4ai.content_filter_strategy import BM25ContentFilter
from crawl4ai import CrawlerRunConfig

bm25_filter = BM25ContentFilter(
    user_query="machine learning",
    bm25_threshold=1.2,
    use_stemming=True
)

md_generator = DefaultMarkdownGenerator(
    content_filter=bm25_filter,
    options={"ignore_links": True}
)

config = CrawlerRunConfig(markdown_generator=md_generator)
user_query: The term you want to focus on. BM25 tries to keep only content blocks relevant to that query.
bm25_threshold: Raise it to keep fewer blocks; lower it to keep more.
use_stemming: If True, variations of words match (e.g., “learn,” “learning,” “learnt”).
No query provided? BM25 tries to glean a context from page metadata, or you can simply treat it as a scorched-earth approach that discards text with low generic score. Realistically, you want to supply a query for best results.

4.2 PruningContentFilter
If you don’t have a specific query, or if you just want a robust “junk remover,” use PruningContentFilter. It analyzes text density, link density, HTML structure, and known patterns (like “nav,” “footer”) to systematically prune extraneous or repetitive sections.

from crawl4ai.content_filter_strategy import PruningContentFilter

prune_filter = PruningContentFilter(
    threshold=0.5,
    threshold_type="fixed",  # or "dynamic"
    min_word_threshold=50
)
threshold: Score boundary. Blocks below this score get removed.
threshold_type:
"fixed": Straight comparison (score >= threshold keeps the block).
"dynamic": The filter adjusts threshold in a data-driven manner.
min_word_threshold: Discard blocks under N words as likely too short or unhelpful.
When to Use PruningContentFilter
- You want a broad cleanup without a user query.
- The page has lots of repeated sidebars, footers, or disclaimers that hamper text extraction.

4.3 LLMContentFilter
For intelligent content filtering and high-quality markdown generation, you can use the LLMContentFilter. This filter leverages LLMs to generate relevant markdown while preserving the original content's meaning and structure:

from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, BrowserConfig, CrawlerRunConfig
from crawl4ai.content_filter_strategy import LLMContentFilter

async def main():
    # Initialize LLM filter with specific instruction
    filter = LLMContentFilter(
        provider="openai/gpt-4o",  # or your preferred provider
        api_token="your-api-token",  # or use environment variable
        instruction="""
        Focus on extracting the core educational content.
        Include:
        - Key concepts and explanations
        - Important code examples
        - Essential technical details
        Exclude:
        - Navigation elements
        - Sidebars
        - Footer content
        Format the output as clean markdown with proper code blocks and headers.
        """,
        chunk_token_threshold=4096,  # Adjust based on your needs
        verbose=True
    )

    config = CrawlerRunConfig(
        content_filter=filter
    )

    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun("https://example.com", config=config)
        print(result.fit_markdown)  # Filtered markdown content
Key Features: - Intelligent Filtering: Uses LLMs to understand and extract relevant content while maintaining context - Customizable Instructions: Tailor the filtering process with specific instructions - Chunk Processing: Handles large documents by processing them in chunks (controlled by chunk_token_threshold) - Parallel Processing: For better performance, use smaller chunk_token_threshold (e.g., 2048 or 4096) to enable parallel processing of content chunks

Two Common Use Cases:

Exact Content Preservation:

filter = LLMContentFilter(
    instruction="""
    Extract the main educational content while preserving its original wording and substance completely.
    1. Maintain the exact language and terminology
    2. Keep all technical explanations and examples intact
    3. Preserve the original flow and structure
    4. Remove only clearly irrelevant elements like navigation menus and ads
    """,
    chunk_token_threshold=4096
)
Focused Content Extraction:

filter = LLMContentFilter(
    instruction="""
    Focus on extracting specific types of content:
    - Technical documentation
    - Code examples
    - API references
    Reformat the content into clear, well-structured markdown
    """,
    chunk_token_threshold=4096
)
Performance Tip: Set a smaller chunk_token_threshold (e.g., 2048 or 4096) to enable parallel processing of content chunks. The default value is infinity, which processes the entire content as a single chunk.

5. Using Fit Markdown
When a content filter is active, the library produces two forms of markdown inside result.markdown_v2 or (if using the simplified field) result.markdown:

1. raw_markdown: The full unfiltered markdown.
2. fit_markdown: A “fit” version where the filter has removed or trimmed noisy segments.

Note:

In earlier examples, you may see references to result.markdown_v2. Depending on your library version, you might access result.markdown, result.markdown_v2, or an object named MarkdownGenerationResult. The idea is the same: you’ll have a raw version and a filtered (“fit”) version if a filter is used.

import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig
from crawl4ai.markdown_generation_strategy import DefaultMarkdownGenerator
from crawl4ai.content_filter_strategy import PruningContentFilter

async def main():
    config = CrawlerRunConfig(
        markdown_generator=DefaultMarkdownGenerator(
            content_filter=PruningContentFilter(threshold=0.6),
            options={"ignore_links": True}
        )
    )
    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun("https://news.example.com/tech", config=config)
        if result.success:
            print("Raw markdown:\n", result.markdown)

            # If a filter is used, we also have .fit_markdown:
            md_object = result.markdown_v2  # or your equivalent
            print("Filtered markdown:\n", md_object.fit_markdown)
        else:
            print("Crawl failed:", result.error_message)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
6. The MarkdownGenerationResult Object
If your library stores detailed markdown output in an object like MarkdownGenerationResult, you’ll see fields such as:

raw_markdown: The direct HTML-to-markdown transformation (no filtering).
markdown_with_citations: A version that moves links to reference-style footnotes.
references_markdown: A separate string or section containing the gathered references.
fit_markdown: The filtered markdown if you used a content filter.
fit_html: The corresponding HTML snippet used to generate fit_markdown (helpful for debugging or advanced usage).
Example:

md_obj = result.markdown_v2  # your library’s naming may vary
print("RAW:\n", md_obj.raw_markdown)
print("CITED:\n", md_obj.markdown_with_citations)
print("REFERENCES:\n", md_obj.references_markdown)
print("FIT:\n", md_obj.fit_markdown)
Why Does This Matter?
- You can supply raw_markdown to an LLM if you want the entire text.
- Or feed fit_markdown into a vector database to reduce token usage.
- references_markdown can help you keep track of link provenance.

Below is a revised section under “Combining Filters (BM25 + Pruning)” that demonstrates how you can run two passes of content filtering without re-crawling, by taking the HTML (or text) from a first pass and feeding it into the second filter. It uses real code patterns from the snippet you provided for BM25ContentFilter, which directly accepts HTML strings (and can also handle plain text with minimal adaptation).

7. Combining Filters (BM25 + Pruning) in Two Passes
You might want to prune out noisy boilerplate first (with PruningContentFilter), and then rank what’s left against a user query (with BM25ContentFilter). You don’t have to crawl the page twice. Instead:

1. First pass: Apply PruningContentFilter directly to the raw HTML from result.html (the crawler’s downloaded HTML).
2. Second pass: Take the pruned HTML (or text) from step 1, and feed it into BM25ContentFilter, focusing on a user query.

Two-Pass Example
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig
from crawl4ai.content_filter_strategy import PruningContentFilter, BM25ContentFilter
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

async def main():
    # 1. Crawl with minimal or no markdown generator, just get raw HTML
    config = CrawlerRunConfig(
        # If you only want raw HTML, you can skip passing a markdown_generator
        # or provide one but focus on .html in this example
    )

    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun("https://example.com/tech-article", config=config)

        if not result.success or not result.html:
            print("Crawl failed or no HTML content.")
            return

        raw_html = result.html

        # 2. First pass: PruningContentFilter on raw HTML
        pruning_filter = PruningContentFilter(threshold=0.5, min_word_threshold=50)

        # filter_content returns a list of "text chunks" or cleaned HTML sections
        pruned_chunks = pruning_filter.filter_content(raw_html)
        # This list is basically pruned content blocks, presumably in HTML or text form

        # For demonstration, let's combine these chunks back into a single HTML-like string
        # or you could do further processing. It's up to your pipeline design.
        pruned_html = "\n".join(pruned_chunks)

        # 3. Second pass: BM25ContentFilter with a user query
        bm25_filter = BM25ContentFilter(
            user_query="machine learning",
            bm25_threshold=1.2,
            language="english"
        )

        # returns a list of text chunks
        bm25_chunks = bm25_filter.filter_content(pruned_html)  

        if not bm25_chunks:
            print("Nothing matched the BM25 query after pruning.")
            return

        # 4. Combine or display final results
        final_text = "\n---\n".join(bm25_chunks)

        print("==== PRUNED OUTPUT (first pass) ====")
        print(pruned_html[:500], "... (truncated)")  # preview

        print("\n==== BM25 OUTPUT (second pass) ====")
        print(final_text[:500], "... (truncated)")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
What’s Happening?
1. Raw HTML: We crawl once and store the raw HTML in result.html.
2. PruningContentFilter: Takes HTML + optional parameters. It extracts blocks of text or partial HTML, removing headings/sections deemed “noise.” It returns a list of text chunks.
3. Combine or Transform: We join these pruned chunks back into a single HTML-like string. (Alternatively, you could store them in a list for further logic—whatever suits your pipeline.)
4. BM25ContentFilter: We feed the pruned string into BM25ContentFilter with a user query. This second pass further narrows the content to chunks relevant to “machine learning.”

No Re-Crawling: We used raw_html from the first pass, so there’s no need to run arun() again—no second network request.

Tips & Variations
Plain Text vs. HTML: If your pruned output is mostly text, BM25 can still handle it; just keep in mind it expects a valid string input. If you supply partial HTML (like "<p>some text</p>"), it will parse it as HTML.
Chaining in a Single Pipeline: If your code supports it, you can chain multiple filters automatically. Otherwise, manual two-pass filtering (as shown) is straightforward.
Adjust Thresholds: If you see too much or too little text in step one, tweak threshold=0.5 or min_word_threshold=50. Similarly, bm25_threshold=1.2 can be raised/lowered for more or fewer chunks in step two.
One-Pass Combination?
If your codebase or pipeline design allows applying multiple filters in one pass, you could do so. But often it’s simpler—and more transparent—to run them sequentially, analyzing each step’s result.

Bottom Line: By manually chaining your filtering logic in two passes, you get powerful incremental control over the final content. First, remove “global” clutter with Pruning, then refine further with BM25-based query relevance—without incurring a second network crawl.

8. Common Pitfalls & Tips
1. No Markdown Output?
- Make sure the crawler actually retrieved HTML. If the site is heavily JS-based, you may need to enable dynamic rendering or wait for elements.
- Check if your content filter is too aggressive. Lower thresholds or disable the filter to see if content reappears.

2. Performance Considerations
- Very large pages with multiple filters can be slower. Consider cache_mode to avoid re-downloading.
- If your final use case is LLM ingestion, consider summarizing further or chunking big texts.

3. Take Advantage of fit_markdown
- Great for RAG pipelines, semantic search, or any scenario where extraneous boilerplate is unwanted.
- Still verify the textual quality—some sites have crucial data in footers or sidebars.

4. Adjusting html2text Options
- If you see lots of raw HTML slipping into the text, turn on escape_html.
- If code blocks look messy, experiment with mark_code or handle_code_in_pre.

9. Summary & Next Steps
In this Markdown Generation Basics tutorial, you learned to:

Configure the DefaultMarkdownGenerator with HTML-to-text options.
Use BM25ContentFilter for query-specific extraction or PruningContentFilter for general noise removal.
Distinguish between raw and filtered markdown (fit_markdown).
Leverage the MarkdownGenerationResult object to handle different forms of output (citations, references, etc.).
Now you can produce high-quality Markdown from any website, focusing on exactly the content you need—an essential step for powering AI models, summarization pipelines, or knowledge-base queries.

Fit Markdown with Pruning & BM25
Fit Markdown is a specialized filtered version of your page’s markdown, focusing on the most relevant content. By default, Crawl4AI converts the entire HTML into a broad raw_markdown. With fit markdown, we apply a content filter algorithm (e.g., Pruning or BM25) to remove or rank low-value sections—such as repetitive sidebars, shallow text blocks, or irrelevancies—leaving a concise textual “core.”

1. How “Fit Markdown” Works
1.1 The content_filter
In CrawlerRunConfig, you can specify a content_filter to shape how content is pruned or ranked before final markdown generation. A filter’s logic is applied before or during the HTML→Markdown process, producing:

result.markdown_v2.raw_markdown (unfiltered)
result.markdown_v2.fit_markdown (filtered or “fit” version)
result.markdown_v2.fit_html (the corresponding HTML snippet that produced fit_markdown)
Note: We’re currently storing the result in markdown_v2, but eventually we’ll unify it as result.markdown.

1.2 Common Filters
1. PruningContentFilter – Scores each node by text density, link density, and tag importance, discarding those below a threshold.
2. BM25ContentFilter – Focuses on textual relevance using BM25 ranking, especially useful if you have a specific user query (e.g., “machine learning” or “food nutrition”).

2. PruningContentFilter
Pruning discards less relevant nodes based on text density, link density, and tag importance. It’s a heuristic-based approach—if certain sections appear too “thin” or too “spammy,” they’re pruned.

2.1 Usage Example
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig
from crawl4ai.content_filter_strategy import PruningContentFilter
from crawl4ai.markdown_generation_strategy import DefaultMarkdownGenerator

async def main():
    # Step 1: Create a pruning filter
    prune_filter = PruningContentFilter(
        # Lower → more content retained, higher → more content pruned
        threshold=0.45,           
        # "fixed" or "dynamic"
        threshold_type="dynamic",  
        # Ignore nodes with <5 words
        min_word_threshold=5      
    )

    # Step 2: Insert it into a Markdown Generator
    md_generator = DefaultMarkdownGenerator(content_filter=prune_filter)

    # Step 3: Pass it to CrawlerRunConfig
    config = CrawlerRunConfig(
        markdown_generator=md_generator
    )

    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(
            url="https://news.ycombinator.com", 
            config=config
        )

        if result.success:
            # 'fit_markdown' is your pruned content, focusing on "denser" text
            print("Raw Markdown length:", len(result.markdown_v2.raw_markdown))
            print("Fit Markdown length:", len(result.markdown_v2.fit_markdown))
        else:
            print("Error:", result.error_message)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
2.2 Key Parameters
min_word_threshold (int): If a block has fewer words than this, it’s pruned.
threshold_type (str):
"fixed" → each node must exceed threshold (0–1).
"dynamic" → node scoring adjusts according to tag type, text/link density, etc.
threshold (float, default ~0.48): The base or “anchor” cutoff.
Algorithmic Factors:

Text density – Encourages blocks that have a higher ratio of text to overall content.
Link density – Penalizes sections that are mostly links.
Tag importance – e.g., an <article> or <p> might be more important than a <div>.
Structural context – If a node is deeply nested or in a suspected sidebar, it might be deprioritized.
3. BM25ContentFilter
BM25 is a classical text ranking algorithm often used in search engines. If you have a user query or rely on page metadata to derive a query, BM25 can identify which text chunks best match that query.

3.1 Usage Example
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig
from crawl4ai.content_filter_strategy import BM25ContentFilter
from crawl4ai.markdown_generation_strategy import DefaultMarkdownGenerator

async def main():
    # 1) A BM25 filter with a user query
    bm25_filter = BM25ContentFilter(
        user_query="startup fundraising tips",
        # Adjust for stricter or looser results
        bm25_threshold=1.2  
    )

    # 2) Insert into a Markdown Generator
    md_generator = DefaultMarkdownGenerator(content_filter=bm25_filter)

    # 3) Pass to crawler config
    config = CrawlerRunConfig(
        markdown_generator=md_generator
    )

    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(
            url="https://news.ycombinator.com", 
            config=config
        )
        if result.success:
            print("Fit Markdown (BM25 query-based):")
            print(result.markdown_v2.fit_markdown)
        else:
            print("Error:", result.error_message)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
3.2 Parameters
user_query (str, optional): E.g. "machine learning". If blank, the filter tries to glean a query from page metadata.
bm25_threshold (float, default 1.0):
Higher → fewer chunks but more relevant.
Lower → more inclusive.
In more advanced scenarios, you might see parameters like use_stemming, case_sensitive, or priority_tags to refine how text is tokenized or weighted.

4. Accessing the “Fit” Output
After the crawl, your “fit” content is found in result.markdown_v2.fit_markdown. In future versions, it will be result.markdown.fit_markdown. Meanwhile:

fit_md = result.markdown_v2.fit_markdown
fit_html = result.markdown_v2.fit_html
If the content filter is BM25, you might see additional logic or references in fit_markdown that highlight relevant segments. If it’s Pruning, the text is typically well-cleaned but not necessarily matched to a query.

5. Code Patterns Recap
5.1 Pruning
prune_filter = PruningContentFilter(
    threshold=0.5,
    threshold_type="fixed",
    min_word_threshold=10
)
md_generator = DefaultMarkdownGenerator(content_filter=prune_filter)
config = CrawlerRunConfig(markdown_generator=md_generator)
# => result.markdown_v2.fit_markdown
5.2 BM25
bm25_filter = BM25ContentFilter(
    user_query="health benefits fruit",
    bm25_threshold=1.2
)
md_generator = DefaultMarkdownGenerator(content_filter=bm25_filter)
config = CrawlerRunConfig(markdown_generator=md_generator)
# => result.markdown_v2.fit_markdown
6. Combining with “word_count_threshold” & Exclusions
Remember you can also specify:

config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    word_count_threshold=10,
    excluded_tags=["nav", "footer", "header"],
    exclude_external_links=True,
    markdown_generator=DefaultMarkdownGenerator(
        content_filter=PruningContentFilter(threshold=0.5)
    )
)
Thus, multi-level filtering occurs:

The crawler’s excluded_tags are removed from the HTML first.
The content filter (Pruning, BM25, or custom) prunes or ranks the remaining text blocks.
The final “fit” content is generated in result.markdown_v2.fit_markdown.
7. Custom Filters
If you need a different approach (like a specialized ML model or site-specific heuristics), you can create a new class inheriting from RelevantContentFilter and implement filter_content(html). Then inject it into your markdown generator:

from crawl4ai.content_filter_strategy import RelevantContentFilter

class MyCustomFilter(RelevantContentFilter):
    def filter_content(self, html, min_word_threshold=None):
        # parse HTML, implement custom logic
        return [block for block in ... if ... some condition...]
Steps:

Subclass RelevantContentFilter.
Implement filter_content(...).
Use it in your DefaultMarkdownGenerator(content_filter=MyCustomFilter(...)).
8. Final Thoughts
Fit Markdown is a crucial feature for:

Summaries: Quickly get the important text from a cluttered page.
Search: Combine with BM25 to produce content relevant to a query.
AI Pipelines: Filter out boilerplate so LLM-based extraction or summarization runs on denser text.
Key Points: - PruningContentFilter: Great if you just want the “meatiest” text without a user query.
- BM25ContentFilter: Perfect for query-based extraction or searching.
- Combine with excluded_tags, exclude_external_links, word_count_threshold to refine your final “fit” text.
- Fit markdown ends up in result.markdown_v2.fit_markdown; eventually result.markdown.fit_markdown in future versions.

With these tools, you can zero in on the text that truly matters, ignoring spammy or boilerplate content, and produce a concise, relevant “fit markdown” for your AI or data pipelines. Happy pruning and searching!

Page Interaction
Crawl4AI provides powerful features for interacting with dynamic webpages, handling JavaScript execution, waiting for conditions, and managing multi-step flows. By combining js_code, wait_for, and certain CrawlerRunConfig parameters, you can:

Click “Load More” buttons
Fill forms and submit them
Wait for elements or data to appear
Reuse sessions across multiple steps
Below is a quick overview of how to do it.

1. JavaScript Execution
Basic Execution
js_code in CrawlerRunConfig accepts either a single JS string or a list of JS snippets.
Example: We’ll scroll to the bottom of the page, then optionally click a “Load More” button.

import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig

async def main():
    # Single JS command
    config = CrawlerRunConfig(
        js_code="window.scrollTo(0, document.body.scrollHeight);"
    )

    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(
            url="https://news.ycombinator.com",  # Example site
            config=config
        )
        print("Crawled length:", len(result.cleaned_html))

    # Multiple commands
    js_commands = [
        "window.scrollTo(0, document.body.scrollHeight);",
        # 'More' link on Hacker News
        "document.querySelector('a.morelink')?.click();",  
    ]
    config = CrawlerRunConfig(js_code=js_commands)

    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(
            url="https://news.ycombinator.com",  # Another pass
            config=config
        )
        print("After scroll+click, length:", len(result.cleaned_html))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Relevant CrawlerRunConfig params: - js_code: A string or list of strings with JavaScript to run after the page loads. - js_only: If set to True on subsequent calls, indicates we’re continuing an existing session without a new full navigation.
- session_id: If you want to keep the same page across multiple calls, specify an ID.

2. Wait Conditions
2.1 CSS-Based Waiting
Sometimes, you just want to wait for a specific element to appear. For example:

import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig

async def main():
    config = CrawlerRunConfig(
        # Wait for at least 30 items on Hacker News
        wait_for="css:.athing:nth-child(30)"  
    )
    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(
            url="https://news.ycombinator.com",
            config=config
        )
        print("We have at least 30 items loaded!")
        # Rough check
        print("Total items in HTML:", result.cleaned_html.count("athing"))  

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Key param: - wait_for="css:...": Tells the crawler to wait until that CSS selector is present.

2.2 JavaScript-Based Waiting
For more complex conditions (e.g., waiting for content length to exceed a threshold), prefix js::

wait_condition = """() => {
    const items = document.querySelectorAll('.athing');
    return items.length > 50;  // Wait for at least 51 items
}"""

config = CrawlerRunConfig(wait_for=f"js:{wait_condition}")
Behind the Scenes: Crawl4AI keeps polling the JS function until it returns true or a timeout occurs.

3. Handling Dynamic Content
Many modern sites require multiple steps: scrolling, clicking “Load More,” or updating via JavaScript. Below are typical patterns.

3.1 Load More Example (Hacker News “More” Link)
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig

async def main():
    # Step 1: Load initial Hacker News page
    config = CrawlerRunConfig(
        wait_for="css:.athing:nth-child(30)"  # Wait for 30 items
    )
    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(
            url="https://news.ycombinator.com",
            config=config
        )
        print("Initial items loaded.")

        # Step 2: Let's scroll and click the "More" link
        load_more_js = [
            "window.scrollTo(0, document.body.scrollHeight);",
            # The "More" link at page bottom
            "document.querySelector('a.morelink')?.click();"  
        ]

        next_page_conf = CrawlerRunConfig(
            js_code=load_more_js,
            wait_for="""js:() => {
                return document.querySelectorAll('.athing').length > 30;
            }""",
            # Mark that we do not re-navigate, but run JS in the same session:
            js_only=True,
            session_id="hn_session"
        )

        # Re-use the same crawler session
        result2 = await crawler.arun(
            url="https://news.ycombinator.com",  # same URL but continuing session
            config=next_page_conf
        )
        total_items = result2.cleaned_html.count("athing")
        print("Items after load-more:", total_items)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Key params: - session_id="hn_session": Keep the same page across multiple calls to arun(). - js_only=True: We’re not performing a full reload, just applying JS in the existing page. - wait_for with js:: Wait for item count to grow beyond 30.

3.2 Form Interaction
If the site has a search or login form, you can fill fields and submit them with js_code. For instance, if GitHub had a local search form:

js_form_interaction = """
document.querySelector('#your-search').value = 'TypeScript commits';
document.querySelector('form').submit();
"""

config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    js_code=js_form_interaction,
    wait_for="css:.commit"
)
result = await crawler.arun(url="https://github.com/search", config=config)
In reality: Replace IDs or classes with the real site’s form selectors.

4. Timing Control
1. page_timeout (ms): Overall page load or script execution time limit.
2. delay_before_return_html (seconds): Wait an extra moment before capturing the final HTML.
3. mean_delay & max_range: If you call arun_many() with multiple URLs, these add a random pause between each request.

Example:

config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    page_timeout=60000,  # 60s limit
    delay_before_return_html=2.5
)
5. Multi-Step Interaction Example
Below is a simplified script that does multiple “Load More” clicks on GitHub’s TypeScript commits page. It re-uses the same session to accumulate new commits each time. The code includes the relevant CrawlerRunConfig parameters you’d rely on.

import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, BrowserConfig, CrawlerRunConfig, CacheMode

async def multi_page_commits():
    browser_cfg = BrowserConfig(
        headless=False,  # Visible for demonstration
        verbose=True
    )
    session_id = "github_ts_commits"

    base_wait = """js:() => {
        const commits = document.querySelectorAll('li.Box-sc-g0xbh4-0 h4');
        return commits.length > 0;
    }"""

    # Step 1: Load initial commits
    config1 = CrawlerRunConfig(
        wait_for=base_wait,
        session_id=session_id,
        cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS,
        # Not using js_only yet since it's our first load
    )

    async with AsyncWebCrawler(config=browser_cfg) as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(
            url="https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/commits/main",
            config=config1
        )
        print("Initial commits loaded. Count:", result.cleaned_html.count("commit"))

        # Step 2: For subsequent pages, we run JS to click 'Next Page' if it exists
        js_next_page = """
        const selector = 'a[data-testid="pagination-next-button"]';
        const button = document.querySelector(selector);
        if (button) button.click();
        """

        # Wait until new commits appear
        wait_for_more = """js:() => {
            const commits = document.querySelectorAll('li.Box-sc-g0xbh4-0 h4');
            if (!window.firstCommit && commits.length>0) {
                window.firstCommit = commits[0].textContent;
                return false;
            }
            // If top commit changes, we have new commits
            const topNow = commits[0]?.textContent.trim();
            return topNow && topNow !== window.firstCommit;
        }"""

        for page in range(2):  # let's do 2 more "Next" pages
            config_next = CrawlerRunConfig(
                session_id=session_id,
                js_code=js_next_page,
                wait_for=wait_for_more,
                js_only=True,       # We're continuing from the open tab
                cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS
            )
            result2 = await crawler.arun(
                url="https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/commits/main",
                config=config_next
            )
            print(f"Page {page+2} commits count:", result2.cleaned_html.count("commit"))

        # Optionally kill session
        await crawler.crawler_strategy.kill_session(session_id)

async def main():
    await multi_page_commits()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Key Points:

session_id: Keep the same page open.
js_code + wait_for + js_only=True: We do partial refreshes, waiting for new commits to appear.
cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS ensures we always see fresh data each step.
6. Combine Interaction with Extraction
Once dynamic content is loaded, you can attach an extraction_strategy (like JsonCssExtractionStrategy or LLMExtractionStrategy). For example:

from crawl4ai.extraction_strategy import JsonCssExtractionStrategy

schema = {
    "name": "Commits",
    "baseSelector": "li.Box-sc-g0xbh4-0",
    "fields": [
        {"name": "title", "selector": "h4.markdown-title", "type": "text"}
    ]
}
config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    session_id="ts_commits_session",
    js_code=js_next_page,
    wait_for=wait_for_more,
    extraction_strategy=JsonCssExtractionStrategy(schema)
)
When done, check result.extracted_content for the JSON.

7. Relevant CrawlerRunConfig Parameters
Below are the key interaction-related parameters in CrawlerRunConfig. For a full list, see Configuration Parameters.

js_code: JavaScript to run after initial load.
js_only: If True, no new page navigation—only JS in the existing session.
wait_for: CSS ("css:...") or JS ("js:...") expression to wait for.
session_id: Reuse the same page across calls.
cache_mode: Whether to read/write from the cache or bypass.
remove_overlay_elements: Remove certain popups automatically.
simulate_user, override_navigator, magic: Anti-bot or “human-like” interactions.
8. Conclusion
Crawl4AI’s page interaction features let you:

1. Execute JavaScript for scrolling, clicks, or form filling.
2. Wait for CSS or custom JS conditions before capturing data.
3. Handle multi-step flows (like “Load More”) with partial reloads or persistent sessions.
4. Combine with structured extraction for dynamic sites.

With these tools, you can scrape modern, interactive webpages confidently. For advanced hooking, user simulation, or in-depth config, check the API reference or related advanced docs. Happy scripting!
Content Selection
Crawl4AI provides multiple ways to select, filter, and refine the content from your crawls. Whether you need to target a specific CSS region, exclude entire tags, filter out external links, or remove certain domains and images, CrawlerRunConfig offers a wide range of parameters.

Below, we show how to configure these parameters and combine them for precise control.

1. CSS-Based Selection
A straightforward way to limit your crawl results to a certain region of the page is css_selector in CrawlerRunConfig:

import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig

async def main():
    config = CrawlerRunConfig(
        # e.g., first 30 items from Hacker News
        css_selector=".athing:nth-child(-n+30)"  
    )
    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(
            url="https://news.ycombinator.com/newest", 
            config=config
        )
        print("Partial HTML length:", len(result.cleaned_html))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Result: Only elements matching that selector remain in result.cleaned_html.

2. Content Filtering & Exclusions
2.1 Basic Overview
config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    # Content thresholds
    word_count_threshold=10,        # Minimum words per block

    # Tag exclusions
    excluded_tags=['form', 'header', 'footer', 'nav'],

    # Link filtering
    exclude_external_links=True,    
    exclude_social_media_links=True,
    # Block entire domains
    exclude_domains=["adtrackers.com", "spammynews.org"],    
    exclude_social_media_domains=["facebook.com", "twitter.com"],

    # Media filtering
    exclude_external_images=True
)
Explanation:

word_count_threshold: Ignores text blocks under X words. Helps skip trivial blocks like short nav or disclaimers.
excluded_tags: Removes entire tags (<form>, <header>, <footer>, etc.).
Link Filtering:
exclude_external_links: Strips out external links and may remove them from result.links.
exclude_social_media_links: Removes links pointing to known social media domains.
exclude_domains: A custom list of domains to block if discovered in links.
exclude_social_media_domains: A curated list (override or add to it) for social media sites.
Media Filtering:
exclude_external_images: Discards images not hosted on the same domain as the main page (or its subdomains).
By default in case you set exclude_social_media_links=True, the following social media domains are excluded:

[
    'facebook.com',
    'twitter.com',
    'x.com',
    'linkedin.com',
    'instagram.com',
    'pinterest.com',
    'tiktok.com',
    'snapchat.com',
    'reddit.com',
]
2.2 Example Usage
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig, CacheMode

async def main():
    config = CrawlerRunConfig(
        css_selector="main.content", 
        word_count_threshold=10,
        excluded_tags=["nav", "footer"],
        exclude_external_links=True,
        exclude_social_media_links=True,
        exclude_domains=["ads.com", "spammytrackers.net"],
        exclude_external_images=True,
        cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS
    )

    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(url="https://news.ycombinator.com", config=config)
        print("Cleaned HTML length:", len(result.cleaned_html))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Note: If these parameters remove too much, reduce or disable them accordingly.

3. Handling Iframes
Some sites embed content in <iframe> tags. If you want that inline:

config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    # Merge iframe content into the final output
    process_iframes=True,    
    remove_overlay_elements=True
)
Usage:

import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig

async def main():
    config = CrawlerRunConfig(
        process_iframes=True,
        remove_overlay_elements=True
    )
    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(
            url="https://example.org/iframe-demo", 
            config=config
        )
        print("Iframe-merged length:", len(result.cleaned_html))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
4. Structured Extraction Examples
You can combine content selection with a more advanced extraction strategy. For instance, a CSS-based or LLM-based extraction strategy can run on the filtered HTML.

4.1 Pattern-Based with JsonCssExtractionStrategy
import asyncio
import json
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig, CacheMode
from crawl4ai.extraction_strategy import JsonCssExtractionStrategy

async def main():
    # Minimal schema for repeated items
    schema = {
        "name": "News Items",
        "baseSelector": "tr.athing",
        "fields": [
            {"name": "title", "selector": "a.storylink", "type": "text"},
            {
                "name": "link", 
                "selector": "a.storylink", 
                "type": "attribute", 
                "attribute": "href"
            }
        ]
    }

    config = CrawlerRunConfig(
        # Content filtering
        excluded_tags=["form", "header"],
        exclude_domains=["adsite.com"],

        # CSS selection or entire page
        css_selector="table.itemlist",

        # No caching for demonstration
        cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS,

        # Extraction strategy
        extraction_strategy=JsonCssExtractionStrategy(schema)
    )

    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(
            url="https://news.ycombinator.com/newest", 
            config=config
        )
        data = json.loads(result.extracted_content)
        print("Sample extracted item:", data[:1])  # Show first item

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
4.2 LLM-Based Extraction
import asyncio
import json
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig
from crawl4ai.extraction_strategy import LLMExtractionStrategy

class ArticleData(BaseModel):
    headline: str
    summary: str

async def main():
    llm_strategy = LLMExtractionStrategy(
        provider="openai/gpt-4",
        api_token="sk-YOUR_API_KEY",
        schema=ArticleData.schema(),
        extraction_type="schema",
        instruction="Extract 'headline' and a short 'summary' from the content."
    )

    config = CrawlerRunConfig(
        exclude_external_links=True,
        word_count_threshold=20,
        extraction_strategy=llm_strategy
    )

    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(url="https://news.ycombinator.com", config=config)
        article = json.loads(result.extracted_content)
        print(article)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Here, the crawler:

Filters out external links (exclude_external_links=True).
Ignores very short text blocks (word_count_threshold=20).
Passes the final HTML to your LLM strategy for an AI-driven parse.
5. Comprehensive Example
Below is a short function that unifies CSS selection, exclusion logic, and a pattern-based extraction, demonstrating how you can fine-tune your final data:

import asyncio
import json
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig, CacheMode
from crawl4ai.extraction_strategy import JsonCssExtractionStrategy

async def extract_main_articles(url: str):
    schema = {
        "name": "ArticleBlock",
        "baseSelector": "div.article-block",
        "fields": [
            {"name": "headline", "selector": "h2", "type": "text"},
            {"name": "summary", "selector": ".summary", "type": "text"},
            {
                "name": "metadata",
                "type": "nested",
                "fields": [
                    {"name": "author", "selector": ".author", "type": "text"},
                    {"name": "date", "selector": ".date", "type": "text"}
                ]
            }
        ]
    }

    config = CrawlerRunConfig(
        # Keep only #main-content
        css_selector="#main-content",

        # Filtering
        word_count_threshold=10,
        excluded_tags=["nav", "footer"],  
        exclude_external_links=True,
        exclude_domains=["somebadsite.com"],
        exclude_external_images=True,

        # Extraction
        extraction_strategy=JsonCssExtractionStrategy(schema),

        cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS
    )

    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(url=url, config=config)
        if not result.success:
            print(f"Error: {result.error_message}")
            return None
        return json.loads(result.extracted_content)

async def main():
    articles = await extract_main_articles("https://news.ycombinator.com/newest")
    if articles:
        print("Extracted Articles:", articles[:2])  # Show first 2

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Why This Works: - CSS scoping with #main-content.
- Multiple exclude_ parameters to remove domains, external images, etc.
- A JsonCssExtractionStrategy to parse repeated article blocks.

6. Scraping Modes
Crawl4AI provides two different scraping strategies for HTML content processing: WebScrapingStrategy (BeautifulSoup-based, default) and LXMLWebScrapingStrategy (LXML-based). The LXML strategy offers significantly better performance, especially for large HTML documents.

from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig, LXMLWebScrapingStrategy

async def main():
    config = CrawlerRunConfig(
        scraping_strategy=LXMLWebScrapingStrategy()  # Faster alternative to default BeautifulSoup
    )
    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(
            url="https://example.com", 
            config=config
        )
You can also create your own custom scraping strategy by inheriting from ContentScrapingStrategy. The strategy must return a ScrapingResult object with the following structure:

from crawl4ai import ContentScrapingStrategy, ScrapingResult, MediaItem, Media, Link, Links

class CustomScrapingStrategy(ContentScrapingStrategy):
    def scrap(self, url: str, html: str, **kwargs) -> ScrapingResult:
        # Implement your custom scraping logic here
        return ScrapingResult(
            cleaned_html="<html>...</html>",  # Cleaned HTML content
            success=True,                     # Whether scraping was successful
            media=Media(
                images=[                      # List of images found
                    MediaItem(
                        src="https://example.com/image.jpg",
                        alt="Image description",
                        desc="Surrounding text",
                        score=1,
                        type="image",
                        group_id=1,
                        format="jpg",
                        width=800
                    )
                ],
                videos=[],                    # List of videos (same structure as images)
                audios=[]                     # List of audio files (same structure as images)
            ),
            links=Links(
                internal=[                    # List of internal links
                    Link(
                        href="https://example.com/page",
                        text="Link text",
                        title="Link title",
                        base_domain="example.com"
                    )
                ],
                external=[]                   # List of external links (same structure)
            ),
            metadata={                        # Additional metadata
                "title": "Page Title",
                "description": "Page description"
            }
        )

    async def ascrap(self, url: str, html: str, **kwargs) -> ScrapingResult:
        # For simple cases, you can use the sync version
        return await asyncio.to_thread(self.scrap, url, html, **kwargs)
Performance Considerations
The LXML strategy can be up to 10-20x faster than BeautifulSoup strategy, particularly when processing large HTML documents. However, please note:

LXML strategy is currently experimental
In some edge cases, the parsing results might differ slightly from BeautifulSoup
If you encounter any inconsistencies between LXML and BeautifulSoup results, please raise an issue with a reproducible example
Choose LXML strategy when: - Processing large HTML documents (recommended for >100KB) - Performance is critical - Working with well-formed HTML

Stick to BeautifulSoup strategy (default) when: - Maximum compatibility is needed - Working with malformed HTML - Exact parsing behavior is critical

7. Conclusion
By mixing css_selector scoping, content filtering parameters, and advanced extraction strategies, you can precisely choose which data to keep. Key parameters in CrawlerRunConfig for content selection include:

1. css_selector – Basic scoping to an element or region.
2. word_count_threshold – Skip short blocks.
3. excluded_tags – Remove entire HTML tags.
4. exclude_external_links, exclude_social_media_links, exclude_domains – Filter out unwanted links or domains.
5. exclude_external_images – Remove images from external sources.
6. process_iframes – Merge iframe content if needed.

Combine these with structured extraction (CSS, LLM-based, or others) to build powerful crawls that yield exactly the content you want, from raw or cleaned HTML up to sophisticated JSON structures. For more detail, see Configuration Reference. Enjoy curating your data to the max!

Crawl4AI Cache System and Migration Guide
Overview
Starting from version 0.5.0, Crawl4AI introduces a new caching system that replaces the old boolean flags with a more intuitive CacheMode enum. This change simplifies cache control and makes the behavior more predictable.

Old vs New Approach
Old Way (Deprecated)
The old system used multiple boolean flags: - bypass_cache: Skip cache entirely - disable_cache: Disable all caching - no_cache_read: Don't read from cache - no_cache_write: Don't write to cache

New Way (Recommended)
The new system uses a single CacheMode enum: - CacheMode.ENABLED: Normal caching (read/write) - CacheMode.DISABLED: No caching at all - CacheMode.READ_ONLY: Only read from cache - CacheMode.WRITE_ONLY: Only write to cache - CacheMode.BYPASS: Skip cache for this operation

Migration Example
Old Code (Deprecated)
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler

async def use_proxy():
    async with AsyncWebCrawler(verbose=True) as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(
            url="https://www.nbcnews.com/business",
            bypass_cache=True  # Old way
        )
        print(len(result.markdown))

async def main():
    await use_proxy()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
New Code (Recommended)
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CacheMode
from crawl4ai.async_configs import CrawlerRunConfig

async def use_proxy():
    # Use CacheMode in CrawlerRunConfig
    config = CrawlerRunConfig(cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS)  
    async with AsyncWebCrawler(verbose=True) as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(
            url="https://www.nbcnews.com/business",
            config=config  # Pass the configuration object
        )
        print(len(result.markdown))

async def main():
    await use_proxy()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Common Migration Patterns
Old Flag	New Mode
bypass_cache=True	cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS
disable_cache=True	cache_mode=CacheMode.DISABLED
no_cache_read=True	cache_mode=CacheMode.WRITE_ONLY
no_cache_write=True	cache_mode=CacheMode.READ_ONLY
Prefix-Based Input Handling in Crawl4AI
This guide will walk you through using the Crawl4AI library to crawl web pages, local HTML files, and raw HTML strings. We'll demonstrate these capabilities using a Wikipedia page as an example.

Crawling a Web URL
To crawl a live web page, provide the URL starting with http:// or https://, using a CrawlerRunConfig object:

import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler
from crawl4ai.async_configs import CrawlerRunConfig

async def crawl_web():
    config = CrawlerRunConfig(bypass_cache=True)
    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(
            url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/apple", 
            config=config
        )
        if result.success:
            print("Markdown Content:")
            print(result.markdown)
        else:
            print(f"Failed to crawl: {result.error_message}")

asyncio.run(crawl_web())
Crawling a Local HTML File
To crawl a local HTML file, prefix the file path with file://.

import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler
from crawl4ai.async_configs import CrawlerRunConfig

async def crawl_local_file():
    local_file_path = "/path/to/apple.html"  # Replace with your file path
    file_url = f"file://{local_file_path}"
    config = CrawlerRunConfig(bypass_cache=True)

    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(url=file_url, config=config)
        if result.success:
            print("Markdown Content from Local File:")
            print(result.markdown)
        else:
            print(f"Failed to crawl local file: {result.error_message}")

asyncio.run(crawl_local_file())
Crawling Raw HTML Content
To crawl raw HTML content, prefix the HTML string with raw:.

import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler
from crawl4ai.async_configs import CrawlerRunConfig

async def crawl_raw_html():
    raw_html = "<html><body><h1>Hello, World!</h1></body></html>"
    raw_html_url = f"raw:{raw_html}"
    config = CrawlerRunConfig(bypass_cache=True)

    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(url=raw_html_url, config=config)
        if result.success:
            print("Markdown Content from Raw HTML:")
            print(result.markdown)
        else:
            print(f"Failed to crawl raw HTML: {result.error_message}")

asyncio.run(crawl_raw_html())
Complete Example
Below is a comprehensive script that:

Crawls the Wikipedia page for "Apple."
Saves the HTML content to a local file (apple.html).
Crawls the local HTML file and verifies the markdown length matches the original crawl.
Crawls the raw HTML content from the saved file and verifies consistency.
import os
import sys
import asyncio
from pathlib import Path
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler
from crawl4ai.async_configs import CrawlerRunConfig

async def main():
    wikipedia_url = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/apple"
    script_dir = Path(__file__).parent
    html_file_path = script_dir / "apple.html"

Conclusion
With the unified url parameter and prefix-based handling in Crawl4AI, you can seamlessly handle web URLs, local HTML files, and raw HTML content. Use CrawlerRunConfig for flexible and consistent configuration in all scenarios.
Link & Media
In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to:

Extract links (internal, external) from crawled pages
Filter or exclude specific domains (e.g., social media or custom domains)
Access and manage media data (especially images) in the crawl result
Configure your crawler to exclude or prioritize certain images
Prerequisites
- You have completed or are familiar with the AsyncWebCrawler Basics tutorial.
- You can run Crawl4AI in your environment (Playwright, Python, etc.).

Below is a revised version of the Link Extraction and Media Extraction sections that includes example data structures showing how links and media items are stored in CrawlResult. Feel free to adjust any field names or descriptions to match your actual output.

1. Link Extraction
1.1 result.links
When you call arun() or arun_many() on a URL, Crawl4AI automatically extracts links and stores them in the links field of CrawlResult. By default, the crawler tries to distinguish internal links (same domain) from external links (different domains).

Basic Example:

from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler

async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
    result = await crawler.arun("https://www.example.com")
    if result.success:
        internal_links = result.links.get("internal", [])
        external_links = result.links.get("external", [])
        print(f"Found {len(internal_links)} internal links.")
        print(f"Found {len(internal_links)} external links.")
        print(f"Found {len(result.media)} media items.")

        # Each link is typically a dictionary with fields like:
        # { "href": "...", "text": "...", "title": "...", "base_domain": "..." }
        if internal_links:
            print("Sample Internal Link:", internal_links[0])
    else:
        print("Crawl failed:", result.error_message)
Structure Example:

result.links = {
  "internal": [
    {
      "href": "https://kidocode.com/",
      "text": "",
      "title": "",
      "base_domain": "kidocode.com"
    },
    {
      "href": "https://kidocode.com/degrees/technology",
      "text": "Technology Degree",
      "title": "KidoCode Tech Program",
      "base_domain": "kidocode.com"
    },
    # ...
  ],
  "external": [
    # possibly other links leading to third-party sites
  ]
}
href: The raw hyperlink URL.
text: The link text (if any) within the <a> tag.
title: The title attribute of the link (if present).
base_domain: The domain extracted from href. Helpful for filtering or grouping by domain.
2. Domain Filtering
Some websites contain hundreds of third-party or affiliate links. You can filter out certain domains at crawl time by configuring the crawler. The most relevant parameters in CrawlerRunConfig are:

exclude_external_links: If True, discard any link pointing outside the root domain.
exclude_social_media_domains: Provide a list of social media platforms (e.g., ["facebook.com", "twitter.com"]) to exclude from your crawl.
exclude_social_media_links: If True, automatically skip known social platforms.
exclude_domains: Provide a list of custom domains you want to exclude (e.g., ["spammyads.com", "tracker.net"]).
2.1 Example: Excluding External & Social Media Links
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, BrowserConfig, CrawlerRunConfig

async def main():
    crawler_cfg = CrawlerRunConfig(
        exclude_external_links=True,          # No links outside primary domain
        exclude_social_media_links=True       # Skip recognized social media domains
    )

    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(
            "https://www.example.com",
            config=crawler_cfg
        )
        if result.success:
            print("[OK] Crawled:", result.url)
            print("Internal links count:", len(result.links.get("internal", [])))
            print("External links count:", len(result.links.get("external", [])))  
            # Likely zero external links in this scenario
        else:
            print("[ERROR]", result.error_message)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
2.2 Example: Excluding Specific Domains
If you want to let external links in, but specifically exclude a domain (e.g., suspiciousads.com), do this:

crawler_cfg = CrawlerRunConfig(
    exclude_domains=["suspiciousads.com"]
)
This approach is handy when you still want external links but need to block certain sites you consider spammy.

3. Media Extraction
3.1 Accessing result.media
By default, Crawl4AI collects images, audio, and video URLs it finds on the page. These are stored in result.media, a dictionary keyed by media type (e.g., images, videos, audio).

Basic Example:

if result.success:
    images_info = result.media.get("images", [])
    print(f"Found {len(images_info)} images in total.")
    for i, img in enumerate(images_info[:5]):  # Inspect just the first 5
        print(f"[Image {i}] URL: {img['src']}")
        print(f"           Alt text: {img.get('alt', '')}")
        print(f"           Score: {img.get('score')}")
        print(f"           Description: {img.get('desc', '')}\n")
Structure Example:

result.media = {
  "images": [
    {
      "src": "https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/.../Group%2089.svg",
      "alt": "coding school for kids",
      "desc": "Trial Class Degrees degrees All Degrees AI Degree Technology ...",
      "score": 3,
      "type": "image",
      "group_id": 0,
      "format": None,
      "width": None,
      "height": None
    },
    # ...
  ],
  "videos": [
    # Similar structure but with video-specific fields
  ],
  "audio": [
    # Similar structure but with audio-specific fields
  ]
}
Depending on your Crawl4AI version or scraping strategy, these dictionaries can include fields like:

src: The media URL (e.g., image source)
alt: The alt text for images (if present)
desc: A snippet of nearby text or a short description (optional)
score: A heuristic relevance score if you’re using content-scoring features
width, height: If the crawler detects dimensions for the image/video
type: Usually "image", "video", or "audio"
group_id: If you’re grouping related media items, the crawler might assign an ID
With these details, you can easily filter out or focus on certain images (for instance, ignoring images with very low scores or a different domain), or gather metadata for analytics.

3.2 Excluding External Images
If you’re dealing with heavy pages or want to skip third-party images (advertisements, for example), you can turn on:

crawler_cfg = CrawlerRunConfig(
    exclude_external_images=True
)
This setting attempts to discard images from outside the primary domain, keeping only those from the site you’re crawling.

3.3 Additional Media Config
screenshot: Set to True if you want a full-page screenshot stored as base64 in result.screenshot.
pdf: Set to True if you want a PDF version of the page in result.pdf.
wait_for_images: If True, attempts to wait until images are fully loaded before final extraction.
4. Putting It All Together: Link & Media Filtering
Here’s a combined example demonstrating how to filter out external links, skip certain domains, and exclude external images:

import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, BrowserConfig, CrawlerRunConfig

async def main():
    # Suppose we want to keep only internal links, remove certain domains, 
    # and discard external images from the final crawl data.
    crawler_cfg = CrawlerRunConfig(
        exclude_external_links=True,
        exclude_domains=["spammyads.com"],
        exclude_social_media_links=True,   # skip Twitter, Facebook, etc.
        exclude_external_images=True,      # keep only images from main domain
        wait_for_images=True,             # ensure images are loaded
        verbose=True
    )

    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun("https://www.example.com", config=crawler_cfg)

        if result.success:
            print("[OK] Crawled:", result.url)

            # 1. Links
            in_links = result.links.get("internal", [])
            ext_links = result.links.get("external", [])
            print("Internal link count:", len(in_links))
            print("External link count:", len(ext_links))  # should be zero with exclude_external_links=True

            # 2. Images
            images = result.media.get("images", [])
            print("Images found:", len(images))

            # Let's see a snippet of these images
            for i, img in enumerate(images[:3]):
                print(f"  - {img['src']} (alt={img.get('alt','')}, score={img.get('score','N/A')})")
        else:
            print("[ERROR] Failed to crawl. Reason:", result.error_message)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
5. Common Pitfalls & Tips
1. Conflicting Flags:
- exclude_external_links=True but then also specifying exclude_social_media_links=True is typically fine, but understand that the first setting already discards all external links. The second becomes somewhat redundant.
- exclude_external_images=True but want to keep some external images? Currently no partial domain-based setting for images, so you might need a custom approach or hook logic.

2. Relevancy Scores:
- If your version of Crawl4AI or your scraping strategy includes an img["score"], it’s typically a heuristic based on size, position, or content analysis. Evaluate carefully if you rely on it.

3. Performance:
- Excluding certain domains or external images can speed up your crawl, especially for large, media-heavy pages.
- If you want a “full” link map, do not exclude them. Instead, you can post-filter in your own code.

4. Social Media Lists:
- exclude_social_media_links=True typically references an internal list of known social domains like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc. If you need to add or remove from that list, look for library settings or a local config file (depending on your version).

That’s it for Link & Media Analysis! You’re now equipped to filter out unwanted sites and zero in on the images and videos that matter for your project.
Overview of Some Important Advanced Features
(Proxy, PDF, Screenshot, SSL, Headers, & Storage State)

Crawl4AI offers multiple power-user features that go beyond simple crawling. This tutorial covers:

1. Proxy Usage
2. Capturing PDFs & Screenshots
3. Handling SSL Certificates
4. Custom Headers
5. Session Persistence & Local Storage 6. Robots.txt Compliance

Prerequisites
- You have a basic grasp of AsyncWebCrawler Basics
- You know how to run or configure your Python environment with Playwright installed

1. Proxy Usage
If you need to route your crawl traffic through a proxy—whether for IP rotation, geo-testing, or privacy—Crawl4AI supports it via BrowserConfig.proxy_config.

import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, BrowserConfig, CrawlerRunConfig

async def main():
    browser_cfg = BrowserConfig(
        proxy_config={
            "server": "http://proxy.example.com:8080",
            "username": "myuser",
            "password": "mypass",
        },
        headless=True
    )
    crawler_cfg = CrawlerRunConfig(
        verbose=True
    )

    async with AsyncWebCrawler(config=browser_cfg) as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(
            url="https://www.whatismyip.com/",
            config=crawler_cfg
        )
        if result.success:
            print("[OK] Page fetched via proxy.")
            print("Page HTML snippet:", result.html[:200])
        else:
            print("[ERROR]", result.error_message)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Key Points
- proxy_config expects a dict with server and optional auth credentials.
- Many commercial proxies provide an HTTP/HTTPS “gateway” server that you specify in server.
- If your proxy doesn’t need auth, omit username/password.

2. Capturing PDFs & Screenshots
Sometimes you need a visual record of a page or a PDF “printout.” Crawl4AI can do both in one pass:

import os, asyncio
from base64 import b64decode
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CacheMode

async def main():
    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(
            url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_common_misconceptions",
            cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS,
            pdf=True,
            screenshot=True
        )

        if result.success:
            # Save screenshot
            if result.screenshot:
                with open("wikipedia_screenshot.png", "wb") as f:
                    f.write(b64decode(result.screenshot))

            # Save PDF
            if result.pdf:
                with open("wikipedia_page.pdf", "wb") as f:
                    f.write(result.pdf)

            print("[OK] PDF & screenshot captured.")
        else:
            print("[ERROR]", result.error_message)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Why PDF + Screenshot?
- Large or complex pages can be slow or error-prone with “traditional” full-page screenshots.
- Exporting a PDF is more reliable for very long pages. Crawl4AI automatically converts the first PDF page into an image if you request both.

Relevant Parameters
- pdf=True: Exports the current page as a PDF (base64-encoded in result.pdf).
- screenshot=True: Creates a screenshot (base64-encoded in result.screenshot).
- scan_full_page or advanced hooking can further refine how the crawler captures content.

3. Handling SSL Certificates
If you need to verify or export a site’s SSL certificate—for compliance, debugging, or data analysis—Crawl4AI can fetch it during the crawl:

import asyncio, os
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig, CacheMode

async def main():
    tmp_dir = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), "tmp")
    os.makedirs(tmp_dir, exist_ok=True)

    config = CrawlerRunConfig(
        fetch_ssl_certificate=True,
        cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS
    )

    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(url="https://example.com", config=config)

        if result.success and result.ssl_certificate:
            cert = result.ssl_certificate
            print("\nCertificate Information:")
            print(f"Issuer (CN): {cert.issuer.get('CN', '')}")
            print(f"Valid until: {cert.valid_until}")
            print(f"Fingerprint: {cert.fingerprint}")

            # Export in multiple formats:
            cert.to_json(os.path.join(tmp_dir, "certificate.json"))
            cert.to_pem(os.path.join(tmp_dir, "certificate.pem"))
            cert.to_der(os.path.join(tmp_dir, "certificate.der"))

            print("\nCertificate exported to JSON/PEM/DER in 'tmp' folder.")
        else:
            print("[ERROR] No certificate or crawl failed.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Key Points
- fetch_ssl_certificate=True triggers certificate retrieval.
- result.ssl_certificate includes methods (to_json, to_pem, to_der) for saving in various formats (handy for server config, Java keystores, etc.).

4. Custom Headers
Sometimes you need to set custom headers (e.g., language preferences, authentication tokens, or specialized user-agent strings). You can do this in multiple ways:

import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler

async def main():
    # Option 1: Set headers at the crawler strategy level
    crawler1 = AsyncWebCrawler(
        # The underlying strategy can accept headers in its constructor
        crawler_strategy=None  # We'll override below for clarity
    )
    crawler1.crawler_strategy.update_user_agent("MyCustomUA/1.0")
    crawler1.crawler_strategy.set_custom_headers({
        "Accept-Language": "fr-FR,fr;q=0.9"
    })
    result1 = await crawler1.arun("https://www.example.com")
    print("Example 1 result success:", result1.success)

    # Option 2: Pass headers directly to `arun()`
    crawler2 = AsyncWebCrawler()
    result2 = await crawler2.arun(
        url="https://www.example.com",
        headers={"Accept-Language": "es-ES,es;q=0.9"}
    )
    print("Example 2 result success:", result2.success)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Notes
- Some sites may react differently to certain headers (e.g., Accept-Language).
- If you need advanced user-agent randomization or client hints, see Identity-Based Crawling (Anti-Bot) or use UserAgentGenerator.

5. Session Persistence & Local Storage
Crawl4AI can preserve cookies and localStorage so you can continue where you left off—ideal for logging into sites or skipping repeated auth flows.

5.1 storage_state
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler

async def main():
    storage_dict = {
        "cookies": [
            {
                "name": "session",
                "value": "abcd1234",
                "domain": "example.com",
                "path": "/",
                "expires": 1699999999.0,
                "httpOnly": False,
                "secure": False,
                "sameSite": "None"
            }
        ],
        "origins": [
            {
                "origin": "https://example.com",
                "localStorage": [
                    {"name": "token", "value": "my_auth_token"}
                ]
            }
        ]
    }

    # Provide the storage state as a dictionary to start "already logged in"
    async with AsyncWebCrawler(
        headless=True,
        storage_state=storage_dict
    ) as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun("https://example.com/protected")
        if result.success:
            print("Protected page content length:", len(result.html))
        else:
            print("Failed to crawl protected page")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
5.2 Exporting & Reusing State
You can sign in once, export the browser context, and reuse it later—without re-entering credentials.

await context.storage_state(path="my_storage.json"): Exports cookies, localStorage, etc. to a file.
Provide storage_state="my_storage.json" on subsequent runs to skip the login step.
See: Detailed session management tutorial or Explanations → Browser Context & Managed Browser for more advanced scenarios (like multi-step logins, or capturing after interactive pages).

6. Robots.txt Compliance
Crawl4AI supports respecting robots.txt rules with efficient caching:

import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig

async def main():
    # Enable robots.txt checking in config
    config = CrawlerRunConfig(
        check_robots_txt=True  # Will check and respect robots.txt rules
    )

    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(
            "https://example.com",
            config=config
        )

        if not result.success and result.status_code == 403:
            print("Access denied by robots.txt")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Key Points - Robots.txt files are cached locally for efficiency - Cache is stored in ~/.crawl4ai/robots/robots_cache.db - Cache has a default TTL of 7 days - If robots.txt can't be fetched, crawling is allowed - Returns 403 status code if URL is disallowed

Putting It All Together
Here’s a snippet that combines multiple “advanced” features (proxy, PDF, screenshot, SSL, custom headers, and session reuse) into one run. Normally, you’d tailor each setting to your project’s needs.

import os, asyncio
from base64 import b64decode
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, BrowserConfig, CrawlerRunConfig, CacheMode

async def main():
    # 1. Browser config with proxy + headless
    browser_cfg = BrowserConfig(
        proxy_config={
            "server": "http://proxy.example.com:8080",
            "username": "myuser",
            "password": "mypass",
        },
        headless=True,
    )

    # 2. Crawler config with PDF, screenshot, SSL, custom headers, and ignoring caches
    crawler_cfg = CrawlerRunConfig(
        pdf=True,
        screenshot=True,
        fetch_ssl_certificate=True,
        cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS,
        headers={"Accept-Language": "en-US,en;q=0.8"},
        storage_state="my_storage.json",  # Reuse session from a previous sign-in
        verbose=True,
    )

    # 3. Crawl

Download Handling in Crawl4AI
This guide explains how to use Crawl4AI to handle file downloads during crawling. You'll learn how to trigger downloads, specify download locations, and access downloaded files.

Enabling Downloads
To enable downloads, set the accept_downloads parameter in the BrowserConfig object and pass it to the crawler.

from crawl4ai.async_configs import BrowserConfig, AsyncWebCrawler

async def main():
    config = BrowserConfig(accept_downloads=True)  # Enable downloads globally
    async with AsyncWebCrawler(config=config) as crawler:
        # ... your crawling logic ...

asyncio.run(main())
Specifying Download Location
Specify the download directory using the downloads_path attribute in the BrowserConfig object. If not provided, Crawl4AI defaults to creating a "downloads" directory inside the .crawl4ai folder in your home directory.

from crawl4ai.async_configs import BrowserConfig
import os

downloads_path = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), "my_downloads")  # Custom download path
os.makedirs(downloads_path, exist_ok=True)

config = BrowserConfig(accept_downloads=True, downloads_path=downloads_path)

async def main():
    async with AsyncWebCrawler(config=config) as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(url="https://example.com")
        # ...
Triggering Downloads
Downloads are typically triggered by user interactions on a web page, such as clicking a download button. Use js_code in CrawlerRunConfig to simulate these actions and wait_for to allow sufficient time for downloads to start.

from crawl4ai.async_configs import CrawlerRunConfig

config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    js_code="""
        const downloadLink = document.querySelector('a[href$=".exe"]');
        if (downloadLink) {
            downloadLink.click();
        }
    """,
    wait_for=5  # Wait 5 seconds for the download to start
)

result = await crawler.arun(url="https://www.python.org/downloads/", config=config)
Accessing Downloaded Files
The downloaded_files attribute of the CrawlResult object contains paths to downloaded files.

if result.downloaded_files:
    print("Downloaded files:")
    for file_path in result.downloaded_files:
        print(f"- {file_path}")
        file_size = os.path.getsize(file_path)
        print(f"- File size: {file_size} bytes")
else:
    print("No files downloaded.")
Example: Downloading Multiple Files
from crawl4ai.async_configs import BrowserConfig, CrawlerRunConfig
import os
from pathlib import Path

async def download_multiple_files(url: str, download_path: str):
    config = BrowserConfig(accept_downloads=True, downloads_path=download_path)
    async with AsyncWebCrawler(config=config) as crawler:
        run_config = CrawlerRunConfig(
            js_code="""
                const downloadLinks = document.querySelectorAll('a[download]');
                for (const link of downloadLinks) {
                    link.click();
                    // Delay between clicks
                    await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 2000));  
                }
            """,
            wait_for=10  # Wait for all downloads to start
        )
        result = await crawler.arun(url=url, config=run_config)

        if result.downloaded_files:
            print("Downloaded files:")
            for file in result.downloaded_files:
                print(f"- {file}")
        else:
            print("No files downloaded.")

# Usage
download_path = os.path.join(Path.home(), ".crawl4ai", "downloads")
os.makedirs(download_path, exist_ok=True)

asyncio.run(download_multiple_files("https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/", download_path))
Important Considerations
Browser Context: Downloads are managed within the browser context. Ensure js_code correctly targets the download triggers on the webpage.
Timing: Use wait_for in CrawlerRunConfig to manage download timing.
Error Handling: Handle errors to manage failed downloads or incorrect paths gracefully.
Security: Scan downloaded files for potential security threats before use.
This revised guide ensures consistency with the Crawl4AI codebase by using BrowserConfig and CrawlerRunConfig for all download-related configurations. Let me know if further adjustments are needed!
Handling Lazy-Loaded Images
Many websites now load images lazily as you scroll. If you need to ensure they appear in your final crawl (and in result.media), consider:

1. wait_for_images=True – Wait for images to fully load.
2. scan_full_page – Force the crawler to scroll the entire page, triggering lazy loads.
3. scroll_delay – Add small delays between scroll steps.

Note: If the site requires multiple “Load More” triggers or complex interactions, see the Page Interaction docs.

Example: Ensuring Lazy Images Appear
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig, BrowserConfig
from crawl4ai.async_configs import CacheMode

async def main():
    config = CrawlerRunConfig(
        # Force the crawler to wait until images are fully loaded
        wait_for_images=True,

        # Option 1: If you want to automatically scroll the page to load images
        scan_full_page=True,  # Tells the crawler to try scrolling the entire page
        scroll_delay=0.5,     # Delay (seconds) between scroll steps

        # Option 2: If the site uses a 'Load More' or JS triggers for images,
        # you can also specify js_code or wait_for logic here.

        cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS,
        verbose=True
    )

    async with AsyncWebCrawler(config=BrowserConfig(headless=True)) as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun("https://www.example.com/gallery", config=config)

        if result.success:
            images = result.media.get("images", [])
            print("Images found:", len(images))
            for i, img in enumerate(images[:5]):
                print(f"[Image {i}] URL: {img['src']}, Score: {img.get('score','N/A')}")
        else:
            print("Error:", result.error_message)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Explanation:

wait_for_images=True
The crawler tries to ensure images have finished loading before finalizing the HTML.
scan_full_page=True
Tells the crawler to attempt scrolling from top to bottom. Each scroll step helps trigger lazy loading.
scroll_delay=0.5
Pause half a second between each scroll step. Helps the site load images before continuing.
When to Use:

Lazy-Loading: If images appear only when the user scrolls into view, scan_full_page + scroll_delay helps the crawler see them.
Heavier Pages: If a page is extremely long, be mindful that scanning the entire page can be slow. Adjust scroll_delay or the max scroll steps as needed.
Combining with Other Link & Media Filters
You can still combine lazy-load logic with the usual exclude_external_images, exclude_domains, or link filtration:

config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    wait_for_images=True,
    scan_full_page=True,
    scroll_delay=0.5,

    # Filter out external images if you only want local ones
    exclude_external_images=True,

    # Exclude certain domains for links
    exclude_domains=["spammycdn.com"],
)
This approach ensures you see all images from the main domain while ignoring external ones, and the crawler physically scrolls the entire page so that lazy-loading triggers.

Tips & Troubleshooting
1. Long Pages
- Setting scan_full_page=True on extremely long or infinite-scroll pages can be resource-intensive.
- Consider using hooks or specialized logic to load specific sections or “Load More” triggers repeatedly.

2. Mixed Image Behavior
- Some sites load images in batches as you scroll. If you’re missing images, increase your scroll_delay or call multiple partial scrolls in a loop with JS code or hooks.

3. Combining with Dynamic Wait
- If the site has a placeholder that only changes to a real image after a certain event, you might do wait_for="css:img.loaded" or a custom JS wait_for.

4. Caching
- If cache_mode is enabled, repeated crawls might skip some network fetches. If you suspect caching is missing new images, set cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS for fresh fetches.

With lazy-loading support, wait_for_images, and scan_full_page settings, you can capture the entire gallery or feed of images you expect—even if the site only loads them as the user scrolls. Combine these with the standard media filtering and domain exclusion for a complete link & media handling strategy.
Hooks & Auth in AsyncWebCrawler
Crawl4AI’s hooks let you customize the crawler at specific points in the pipeline:

1. on_browser_created – After browser creation.
2. on_page_context_created – After a new context & page are created.
3. before_goto – Just before navigating to a page.
4. after_goto – Right after navigation completes.
5. on_user_agent_updated – Whenever the user agent changes.
6. on_execution_started – Once custom JavaScript execution begins.
7. before_retrieve_html – Just before the crawler retrieves final HTML.
8. before_return_html – Right before returning the HTML content.

Important: Avoid heavy tasks in on_browser_created since you don’t yet have a page context. If you need to log in, do so in on_page_context_created.

note "Important Hook Usage Warning" Avoid Misusing Hooks: Do not manipulate page objects in the wrong hook or at the wrong time, as it can crash the pipeline or produce incorrect results. A common mistake is attempting to handle authentication prematurely—such as creating or closing pages in on_browser_created.

Use the Right Hook for Auth: If you need to log in or set tokens, use on_page_context_created. This ensures you have a valid page/context to work with, without disrupting the main crawling flow.

Identity-Based Crawling: For robust auth, consider identity-based crawling (or passing a session ID) to preserve state. Run your initial login steps in a separate, well-defined process, then feed that session to your main crawl—rather than shoehorning complex authentication into early hooks. Check out Identity-Based Crawling for more details.

Be Cautious: Overwriting or removing elements in the wrong hook can compromise the final crawl. Keep hooks focused on smaller tasks (like route filters, custom headers), and let your main logic (crawling, data extraction) proceed normally.

Below is an example demonstration.

Example: Using Hooks in AsyncWebCrawler
import asyncio
import json
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, BrowserConfig, CrawlerRunConfig, CacheMode
from playwright.async_api import Page, BrowserContext

async def main():
    print("🔗 Hooks Example: Demonstrating recommended usage")

    # 1) Configure the browser
    browser_config = BrowserConfig(

    # 2) Configure the crawler run
    crawler_run_config = CrawlerRunConfig(
        js_code="window.scrollTo(0, document.body.scrollHeight);",
        wait_for="body",
        cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS
    )

    # 3) Create the crawler instance
    crawler = AsyncWebCrawler(config=browser_config)

    #
    # Define Hook Functions

        # Typically, do minimal setup here if needed
        return browser

    async def on_page_context_created(page: Page, context: BrowserContext, **kwargs):
        # Called right after a new page + context are created (ideal for auth or route config).
        print("[HOOK] on_page_context_created - Setting up page & context.")

        # Example 1: Route filtering (e.g., block images)
        async def route_filter(route):
            if route.request.resource_type == "image":
                print(f"[HOOK] Blocking image request: {route.request.url}")
                await route.abort()
            else:
                await route.continue_()

        await context.route("**", route_filter)

        # Example 2: (Optional) Simulate a login scenario
        # (We do NOT create or close pages here, just do quick steps if needed)
        # e.g., await page.goto("https://example.com/login")

    await crawler.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Hook Lifecycle Summary
1. on_browser_created:
- Browser is up, but no pages or contexts yet.
- Light setup only—don’t try to open or close pages here (that belongs in on_page_context_created).

2. on_page_context_created:
- Perfect for advanced auth or route blocking.
- You have a page + context ready but haven’t navigated to the target URL yet.

3. before_goto:
- Right before navigation. Typically used for setting custom headers or logging the target URL.

4. after_goto:
- After page navigation is done. Good place for verifying content or waiting on essential elements.

5. on_user_agent_updated:
- Whenever the user agent changes (for stealth or different UA modes).

6. on_execution_started:
- If you set js_code or run custom scripts, this runs once your JS is about to start.

7. before_retrieve_html:
- Just before the final HTML snapshot is taken. Often you do a final scroll or lazy-load triggers here.

8. before_return_html:
- The last hook before returning HTML to the CrawlResult. Good for logging HTML length or minor modifications.

When to Handle Authentication
Recommended: Use on_page_context_created if you need to:

Navigate to a login page or fill forms
Set cookies or localStorage tokens
Block resource routes to avoid ads
This ensures the newly created context is under your control before arun() navigates to the main URL.

Additional Considerations
Session Management: If you want multiple arun() calls to reuse a single session, pass session_id= in your CrawlerRunConfig. Hooks remain the same.
Performance: Hooks can slow down crawling if they do heavy tasks. Keep them concise.
Error Handling: If a hook fails, the overall crawl might fail. Catch exceptions or handle them gracefully.
Concurrency: If you run arun_many(), each URL triggers these hooks in parallel. Ensure your hooks are thread/async-safe.
Conclusion
Hooks provide fine-grained control over:

Browser creation (light tasks only)
Page and context creation (auth, route blocking)
Navigation phases
Final HTML retrieval
Follow the recommended usage: - Login or advanced tasks in on_page_context_created
- Custom headers or logs in before_goto / after_goto
- Scrolling or final checks in before_retrieve_html / before_return_html
Proxy
Basic Proxy Setup
Simple proxy configuration with BrowserConfig:

from crawl4ai.async_configs import BrowserConfig

# Using proxy URL
browser_config = BrowserConfig(proxy="http://proxy.example.com:8080")
async with AsyncWebCrawler(config=browser_config) as crawler:
    result = await crawler.arun(url="https://example.com")

# Using SOCKS proxy
browser_config = BrowserConfig(proxy="socks5://proxy.example.com:1080")
async with AsyncWebCrawler(config=browser_config) as crawler:
    result = await crawler.arun(url="https://example.com")
Authenticated Proxy
Use an authenticated proxy with BrowserConfig:

from crawl4ai.async_configs import BrowserConfig

proxy_config = {
    "server": "http://proxy.example.com:8080",
    "username": "user",
    "password": "pass"
}

browser_config = BrowserConfig(proxy_config=proxy_config)
async with AsyncWebCrawler(config=browser_config) as crawler:
    result = await crawler.arun(url="https://example.com")
Here's the corrected documentation:

Rotating Proxies
Example using a proxy rotation service dynamically:

from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, BrowserConfig, CrawlerRunConfig

async def get_next_proxy():
    # Your proxy rotation logic here
    return {"server": "http://next.proxy.com:8080"}

async def main():
    browser_config = BrowserConfig()
    run_config = CrawlerRunConfig()

    async with AsyncWebCrawler(config=browser_config) as crawler:
        # For each URL, create a new run config with different proxy
        for url in urls:
            proxy = await get_next_proxy()
            # Clone the config and update proxy - this creates a new browser context
            current_config = run_config.clone(proxy_config=proxy)
            result = await crawler.arun(url=url, config=current_config)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import asyncio
    asyncio.run(main())
Session Management
Session management in Crawl4AI is a powerful feature that allows you to maintain state across multiple requests, making it particularly suitable for handling complex multi-step crawling tasks. It enables you to reuse the same browser tab (or page object) across sequential actions and crawls, which is beneficial for:

Performing JavaScript actions before and after crawling.
Executing multiple sequential crawls faster without needing to reopen tabs or allocate memory repeatedly.
Note: This feature is designed for sequential workflows and is not suitable for parallel operations.

Basic Session Usage
Use BrowserConfig and CrawlerRunConfig to maintain state with a session_id:

from crawl4ai.async_configs import BrowserConfig, CrawlerRunConfig

async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
    session_id = "my_session"

    # Define configurations
    config1 = CrawlerRunConfig(
        url="https://example.com/page1", session_id=session_id
    )
    config2 = CrawlerRunConfig(
        url="https://example.com/page2", session_id=session_id
    )

    # First request
    result1 = await crawler.arun(config=config1)

    # Subsequent request using the same session
    result2 = await crawler.arun(config=config2)

    # Clean up when done
    await crawler.crawler_strategy.kill_session(session_id)
Dynamic Content with Sessions
Here's an example of crawling GitHub commits across multiple pages while preserving session state:

from crawl4ai.async_configs import CrawlerRunConfig
from crawl4ai.extraction_strategy import JsonCssExtractionStrategy
from crawl4ai.cache_context import CacheMode

async def crawl_dynamic_content():
    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        session_id = "github_commits_session"
        url = "https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/commits/main"
        all_commits = []

        # Define extraction schema
        schema = {
            "name": "Commit Extractor",
            "baseSelector": "li.Box-sc-g0xbh4-0",
            "fields": [{
                "name": "title", "selector": "h4.markdown-title", "type": "text"
            }],
        }
        extraction_strategy = JsonCssExtractionStrategy(schema)

        # JavaScript and wait configurations
        js_next_page = """document.querySelector('a[data-testid="pagination-next-button"]').click();"""
        wait_for = """() => document.querySelectorAll('li.Box-sc-g0xbh4-0').length > 0"""

        # Crawl multiple pages
        for page in range(3):
            config = CrawlerRunConfig(
                url=url,
                session_id=session_id,
                extraction_strategy=extraction_strategy,
                js_code=js_next_page if page > 0 else None,
                wait_for=wait_for if page > 0 else None,
                js_only=page > 0,
                cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS
            )

            result = await crawler.arun(config=config)
            if result.success:
                commits = json.loads(result.extracted_content)
                all_commits.extend(commits)
                print(f"Page {page + 1}: Found {len(commits)} commits")

        # Clean up session
        await crawler.crawler_strategy.kill_session(session_id)
        return all_commits
Example 1: Basic Session-Based Crawling
A simple example using session-based crawling:

import asyncio
from crawl4ai.async_configs import BrowserConfig, CrawlerRunConfig
from crawl4ai.cache_context import CacheMode

async def basic_session_crawl():
    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        session_id = "dynamic_content_session"
        url = "https://example.com/dynamic-content"

        for page in range(3):
            config = CrawlerRunConfig(
                url=url,
                session_id=session_id,
                js_code="document.querySelector('.load-more-button').click();" if page > 0 else None,
                css_selector=".content-item",
                cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS
            )

            result = await crawler.arun(config=config)
            print(f"Page {page + 1}: Found {result.extracted_content.count('.content-item')} items")

        await crawler.crawler_strategy.kill_session(session_id)

asyncio.run(basic_session_crawl())
This example shows: 1. Reusing the same session_id across multiple requests. 2. Executing JavaScript to load more content dynamically. 3. Properly closing the session to free resources.

Advanced Technique 1: Custom Execution Hooks
Warning: You might feel confused by the end of the next few examples 😅, so make sure you are comfortable with the order of the parts before you start this.

Use custom hooks to handle complex scenarios, such as waiting for content to load dynamically:

async def advanced_session_crawl_with_hooks():
    first_commit = ""

    async def on_execution_started(page):
        nonlocal first_commit
        try:
            while True:
                await page.wait_for_selector("li.commit-item h4")
                commit = await page.query_selector("li.commit-item h4")
                commit = await commit.evaluate("(element) => element.textContent").strip()
                if commit and commit != first_commit:
                    first_commit = commit
                    break
                await asyncio.sleep(0.5)
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Warning: New content didn't appear: {e}")

    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        session_id = "commit_session"
        url = "https://github.com/example/repo/commits/main"
        crawler.crawler_strategy.set_hook("on_execution_started", on_execution_started)

        js_next_page = """document.querySelector('a.pagination-next').click();"""

        for page in range(3):
            config = CrawlerRunConfig(
                url=url,
                session_id=session_id,
                js_code=js_next_page if page > 0 else None,
                css_selector="li.commit-item",
                js_only=page > 0,
                cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS
            )

            result = await crawler.arun(config=config)
            print(f"Page {page + 1}: Found {len(result.extracted_content)} commits")

        await crawler.crawler_strategy.kill_session(session_id)

asyncio.run(advanced_session_crawl_with_hooks())
This technique ensures new content loads before the next action.

Advanced Technique 2: Integrated JavaScript Execution and Waiting
Combine JavaScript execution and waiting logic for concise handling of dynamic content:

async def integrated_js_and_wait_crawl():
    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        session_id = "integrated_session"
        url = "https://github.com/example/repo/commits/main"

        js_next_page_and_wait = """
        (async () => {
            const getCurrentCommit = () => document.querySelector('li.commit-item h4').textContent.trim();
            const initialCommit = getCurrentCommit();
            document.querySelector('a.pagination-next').click();
            while (getCurrentCommit() === initialCommit) {
                await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100));
            }
        })();
        """

        for page in range(3):
            config = CrawlerRunConfig(
                url=url,
                session_id=session_id,
                js_code=js_next_page_and_wait if page > 0 else None,
                css_selector="li.commit-item",
                js_only=page > 0,
                cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS
            )

            result = await crawler.arun(config=config)
            print(f"Page {page + 1}: Found {len(result.extracted_content)} commits")

        await crawler.crawler_strategy.kill_session(session_id)

asyncio.run(integrated_js_and_wait_crawl())
Common Use Cases for Sessions
1. Authentication Flows: Login and interact with secured pages.

2. Pagination Handling: Navigate through multiple pages.

3. Form Submissions: Fill forms, submit, and process results.

4. Multi-step Processes: Complete workflows that span multiple actions.

5. Dynamic Content Navigation: Handle JavaScript-rendered or event-triggered content.
Advanced Multi-URL Crawling with Dispatchers
Heads Up: Crawl4AI supports advanced dispatchers for parallel or throttled crawling, providing dynamic rate limiting and memory usage checks. The built-in arun_many() function uses these dispatchers to handle concurrency efficiently.

1. Introduction
When crawling many URLs:

Basic: Use arun() in a loop (simple but less efficient)
Better: Use arun_many(), which efficiently handles multiple URLs with proper concurrency control
Best: Customize dispatcher behavior for your specific needs (memory management, rate limits, etc.)
Why Dispatchers?

Adaptive: Memory-based dispatchers can pause or slow down based on system resources
Rate-limiting: Built-in rate limiting with exponential backoff for 429/503 responses
Real-time Monitoring: Live dashboard of ongoing tasks, memory usage, and performance
Flexibility: Choose between memory-adaptive or semaphore-based concurrency
2. Core Components
2.1 Rate Limiter
class RateLimiter:
    def __init__(
        # Random delay range between requests
        base_delay: Tuple[float, float] = (1.0, 3.0),  

        # Maximum backoff delay
        max_delay: float = 60.0,                        

        # Retries before giving up
        max_retries: int = 3,                          

        # Status codes triggering backoff
        rate_limit_codes: List[int] = [429, 503]        
    )
Here’s the revised and simplified explanation of the RateLimiter, focusing on constructor parameters and adhering to your markdown style and mkDocs guidelines.

RateLimiter Constructor Parameters
The RateLimiter is a utility that helps manage the pace of requests to avoid overloading servers or getting blocked due to rate limits. It operates internally to delay requests and handle retries but can be configured using its constructor parameters.

Parameters of the RateLimiter constructor:

1. base_delay (Tuple[float, float], default: (1.0, 3.0))
  The range for a random delay (in seconds) between consecutive requests to the same domain.

A random delay is chosen between base_delay[0] and base_delay[1] for each request.
This prevents sending requests at a predictable frequency, reducing the chances of triggering rate limits.
Example:
If base_delay = (2.0, 5.0), delays could be randomly chosen as 2.3s, 4.1s, etc.

2. max_delay (float, default: 60.0)
  The maximum allowable delay when rate-limiting errors occur.

When servers return rate-limit responses (e.g., 429 or 503), the delay increases exponentially with jitter.
The max_delay ensures the delay doesn’t grow unreasonably high, capping it at this value.
Example:
For a max_delay = 30.0, even if backoff calculations suggest a delay of 45s, it will cap at 30s.

3. max_retries (int, default: 3)
  The maximum number of retries for a request if rate-limiting errors occur.

After encountering a rate-limit response, the RateLimiter retries the request up to this number of times.
If all retries fail, the request is marked as failed, and the process continues.
Example:
If max_retries = 3, the system retries a failed request three times before giving up.

4. rate_limit_codes (List[int], default: [429, 503])
  A list of HTTP status codes that trigger the rate-limiting logic.

These status codes indicate the server is overwhelmed or actively limiting requests.
You can customize this list to include other codes based on specific server behavior.
Example:
If rate_limit_codes = [429, 503, 504], the crawler will back off on these three error codes.

How to Use the RateLimiter:

Here’s an example of initializing and using a RateLimiter in your project:

from crawl4ai import RateLimiter

# Create a RateLimiter with custom settings
rate_limiter = RateLimiter(
    base_delay=(2.0, 4.0),  # Random delay between 2-4 seconds
    max_delay=30.0,         # Cap delay at 30 seconds
    max_retries=5,          # Retry up to 5 times on rate-limiting errors
    rate_limit_codes=[429, 503]  # Handle these HTTP status codes
)

# RateLimiter will handle delays and retries internally
# No additional setup is required for its operation
The RateLimiter integrates seamlessly with dispatchers like MemoryAdaptiveDispatcher and SemaphoreDispatcher, ensuring requests are paced correctly without user intervention. Its internal mechanisms manage delays and retries to avoid overwhelming servers while maximizing efficiency.

2.2 Crawler Monitor
The CrawlerMonitor provides real-time visibility into crawling operations:

from crawl4ai import CrawlerMonitor, DisplayMode
monitor = CrawlerMonitor(
    # Maximum rows in live display
    max_visible_rows=15,          

    # DETAILED or AGGREGATED view
    display_mode=DisplayMode.DETAILED  
)
Display Modes:

DETAILED: Shows individual task status, memory usage, and timing
AGGREGATED: Displays summary statistics and overall progress
3. Available Dispatchers
3.1 MemoryAdaptiveDispatcher (Default)
Automatically manages concurrency based on system memory usage:

from crawl4ai.async_dispatcher import MemoryAdaptiveDispatcher

dispatcher = MemoryAdaptiveDispatcher(
    memory_threshold_percent=90.0,  # Pause if memory exceeds this
    check_interval=1.0,             # How often to check memory
    max_session_permit=10,          # Maximum concurrent tasks
    rate_limiter=RateLimiter(       # Optional rate limiting
        base_delay=(1.0, 2.0),
        max_delay=30.0,
        max_retries=2
    ),
    monitor=CrawlerMonitor(         # Optional monitoring
        max_visible_rows=15,
        display_mode=DisplayMode.DETAILED
    )
)
Constructor Parameters:

1. memory_threshold_percent (float, default: 90.0)
  Specifies the memory usage threshold (as a percentage). If system memory usage exceeds this value, the dispatcher pauses crawling to prevent system overload.

2. check_interval (float, default: 1.0)
  The interval (in seconds) at which the dispatcher checks system memory usage.

3. max_session_permit (int, default: 10)
  The maximum number of concurrent crawling tasks allowed. This ensures resource limits are respected while maintaining concurrency.

4. memory_wait_timeout (float, default: 300.0)
  Optional timeout (in seconds). If memory usage exceeds memory_threshold_percent for longer than this duration, a MemoryError is raised.

5. rate_limiter (RateLimiter, default: None)
  Optional rate-limiting logic to avoid server-side blocking (e.g., for handling 429 or 503 errors). See RateLimiter for details.

6. monitor (CrawlerMonitor, default: None)
  Optional monitoring for real-time task tracking and performance insights. See CrawlerMonitor for details.

3.2 SemaphoreDispatcher
Provides simple concurrency control with a fixed limit:

from crawl4ai.async_dispatcher import SemaphoreDispatcher

dispatcher = SemaphoreDispatcher(
    max_session_permit=20,         # Maximum concurrent tasks
    rate_limiter=RateLimiter(      # Optional rate limiting
        base_delay=(0.5, 1.0),
        max_delay=10.0
    ),
    monitor=CrawlerMonitor(        # Optional monitoring
        max_visible_rows=15,
        display_mode=DisplayMode.DETAILED
    )
)
Constructor Parameters:

1. max_session_permit (int, default: 20)
  The maximum number of concurrent crawling tasks allowed, irrespective of semaphore slots.

2. rate_limiter (RateLimiter, default: None)
  Optional rate-limiting logic to avoid overwhelming servers. See RateLimiter for details.

3. monitor (CrawlerMonitor, default: None)
  Optional monitoring for tracking task progress and resource usage. See CrawlerMonitor for details.

4. Usage Examples
4.1 Batch Processing (Default)
async def crawl_batch():
    browser_config = BrowserConfig(headless=True, verbose=False)
    run_config = CrawlerRunConfig(
        cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS,
        stream=False  # Default: get all results at once
    )

    dispatcher = MemoryAdaptiveDispatcher(
        memory_threshold_percent=70.0,
        check_interval=1.0,
        max_session_permit=10,
        monitor=CrawlerMonitor(
            display_mode=DisplayMode.DETAILED
        )
    )

    async with AsyncWebCrawler(config=browser_config) as crawler:
        # Get all results at once
        results = await crawler.arun_many(
            urls=urls,
            config=run_config,
            dispatcher=dispatcher
        )

        # Process all results after completion
        for result in results:
            if result.success:
                await process_result(result)
            else:
                print(f"Failed to crawl {result.url}: {result.error_message}")
Review:
- Purpose: Executes a batch crawl with all URLs processed together after crawling is complete.
- Dispatcher: Uses MemoryAdaptiveDispatcher to manage concurrency and system memory.
- Stream: Disabled (stream=False), so all results are collected at once for post-processing.
- Best Use Case: When you need to analyze results in bulk rather than individually during the crawl.

4.2 Streaming Mode
async def crawl_streaming():
    browser_config = BrowserConfig(headless=True, verbose=False)
    run_config = CrawlerRunConfig(
        cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS,
        stream=True  # Enable streaming mode
    )

    dispatcher = MemoryAdaptiveDispatcher(
        memory_threshold_percent=70.0,
        check_interval=1.0,
        max_session_permit=10,
        monitor=CrawlerMonitor(
            display_mode=DisplayMode.DETAILED
        )
    )

    async with AsyncWebCrawler(config=browser_config) as crawler:
        # Process results as they become available
        async for result in await crawler.arun_many(
            urls=urls,
            config=run_config,
            dispatcher=dispatcher
        ):
            if result.success:
                # Process each result immediately
                await process_result(result)
            else:
                print(f"Failed to crawl {result.url}: {result.error_message}")
Review:
- Purpose: Enables streaming to process results as soon as they’re available.
- Dispatcher: Uses MemoryAdaptiveDispatcher for concurrency and memory management.
- Stream: Enabled (stream=True), allowing real-time processing during crawling.
- Best Use Case: When you need to act on results immediately, such as for real-time analytics or progressive data storage.

4.3 Semaphore-based Crawling
async def crawl_with_semaphore(urls):
    browser_config = BrowserConfig(headless=True, verbose=False)
    run_config = CrawlerRunConfig(cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS)

    dispatcher = SemaphoreDispatcher(
        semaphore_count=5,
        rate_limiter=RateLimiter(
            base_delay=(0.5, 1.0),
            max_delay=10.0
        ),
        monitor=CrawlerMonitor(
            max_visible_rows=15,
            display_mode=DisplayMode.DETAILED
        )
    )

    async with AsyncWebCrawler(config=browser_config) as crawler:
        results = await crawler.arun_many(
            urls, 
            config=run_config,
            dispatcher=dispatcher
        )
        return results
Review:
- Purpose: Uses SemaphoreDispatcher to limit concurrency with a fixed number of slots.
- Dispatcher: Configured with a semaphore to control parallel crawling tasks.
- Rate Limiter: Prevents servers from being overwhelmed by pacing requests.
- Best Use Case: When you want precise control over the number of concurrent requests, independent of system memory.

4.4 Robots.txt Consideration
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig, CacheMode

async def main():
    urls = [
        "https://example1.com",
        "https://example2.com",
        "https://example3.com"
    ]

    config = CrawlerRunConfig(
        cache_mode=CacheMode.ENABLED,
        check_robots_txt=True,  # Will respect robots.txt for each URL
        semaphore_count=3      # Max concurrent requests
    )

    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        async for result in crawler.arun_many(urls, config=config):
            if result.success:
                print(f"Successfully crawled {result.url}")
            elif result.status_code == 403 and "robots.txt" in result.error_message:
                print(f"Skipped {result.url} - blocked by robots.txt")
            else:
                print(f"Failed to crawl {result.url}: {result.error_message}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Review:
- Purpose: Ensures compliance with robots.txt rules for ethical and legal web crawling.
- Configuration: Set check_robots_txt=True to validate each URL against robots.txt before crawling.
- Dispatcher: Handles requests with concurrency limits (semaphore_count=3).
- Best Use Case: When crawling websites that strictly enforce robots.txt policies or for responsible crawling practices.

5. Dispatch Results
Each crawl result includes dispatch information:

@dataclass
class DispatchResult:
    task_id: str
    memory_usage: float
    peak_memory: float
    start_time: datetime
    end_time: datetime
    error_message: str = ""
Access via result.dispatch_result:

for result in results:
    if result.success:
        dr = result.dispatch_result
        print(f"URL: {result.url}")
        print(f"Memory: {dr.memory_usage:.1f}MB")
        print(f"Duration: {dr.end_time - dr.start_time}")
6. Summary
1. Two Dispatcher Types:

MemoryAdaptiveDispatcher (default): Dynamic concurrency based on memory
SemaphoreDispatcher: Fixed concurrency limit
2. Optional Components:

RateLimiter: Smart request pacing and backoff
CrawlerMonitor: Real-time progress visualization
3. Key Benefits:

Automatic memory management

Flexible concurrency control
Choose the dispatcher that best fits your needs:

MemoryAdaptiveDispatcher: For large crawls or limited resources
SemaphoreDispatcher: For simple, fixed-concurrency scenarios
Crawl Dispatcher
We’re excited to announce a Crawl Dispatcher module that can handle thousands of crawling tasks simultaneously. By efficiently managing system resources (memory, CPU, network), this dispatcher ensures high-performance data extraction at scale. It also provides real-time monitoring of each crawler’s status, memory usage, and overall progress.

Stay tuned—this feature is coming soon in an upcoming release of Crawl4AI! For the latest news, keep an eye on our changelogs and follow @unclecode on X.

Below is a sample of how the dispatcher’s performance monitor might look in action:

Preserve Your Identity with Crawl4AI
Crawl4AI empowers you to navigate and interact with the web using your authentic digital identity, ensuring you’re recognized as a human and not mistaken for a bot. This tutorial covers:

1. Managed Browsers – The recommended approach for persistent profiles and identity-based crawling.
2. Magic Mode – A simplified fallback solution for quick automation without persistent identity.

1. Managed Browsers: Your Digital Identity Solution
Managed Browsers let developers create and use persistent browser profiles. These profiles store local storage, cookies, and other session data, letting you browse as your real self—complete with logins, preferences, and cookies.

Key Benefits
Authentic Browsing Experience: Retain session data and browser fingerprints as though you’re a normal user.
Effortless Configuration: Once you log in or solve CAPTCHAs in your chosen data directory, you can re-run crawls without repeating those steps.
Empowered Data Access: If you can see the data in your own browser, you can automate its retrieval with your genuine identity.
Below is a partial update to your Managed Browsers tutorial, specifically the section about creating a user-data directory using Playwright’s Chromium binary rather than a system-wide Chrome/Edge. We’ll show how to locate that binary and launch it with a --user-data-dir argument to set up your profile. You can then point BrowserConfig.user_data_dir to that folder for subsequent crawls.

Creating a User Data Directory (Command-Line Approach via Playwright)
If you installed Crawl4AI (which installs Playwright under the hood), you already have a Playwright-managed Chromium on your system. Follow these steps to launch that Chromium from your command line, specifying a custom data directory:

1. Find the Playwright Chromium binary: - On most systems, installed browsers go under a ~/.cache/ms-playwright/ folder or similar path.
- To see an overview of installed browsers, run:

python -m playwright install --dry-run
or
playwright install --dry-run
(depending on your environment). This shows where Playwright keeps Chromium.
For instance, you might see a path like:
~/.cache/ms-playwright/chromium-1234/chrome-linux/chrome
on Linux, or a corresponding folder on macOS/Windows.
2. Launch the Playwright Chromium binary with a custom user-data directory:

# Linux example
~/.cache/ms-playwright/chromium-1234/chrome-linux/chrome \
    --user-data-dir=/home/<you>/my_chrome_profile
# macOS example (Playwright’s internal binary)
~/Library/Caches/ms-playwright/chromium-1234/chrome-mac/Chromium.app/Contents/MacOS/Chromium \
    --user-data-dir=/Users/<you>/my_chrome_profile
# Windows example (PowerShell/cmd)
"C:\Users\<you>\AppData\Local\ms-playwright\chromium-1234\chrome-win\chrome.exe" ^
    --user-data-dir="C:\Users\<you>\my_chrome_profile"
Replace the path with the actual subfolder indicated in your ms-playwright cache structure.
- This opens a fresh Chromium with your new or existing data folder.
- Log into any sites or configure your browser the way you want.
- Close when done—your profile data is saved in that folder.

3. Use that folder in BrowserConfig.user_data_dir:

from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, BrowserConfig, CrawlerRunConfig

browser_config = BrowserConfig(
    headless=True,
    use_managed_browser=True,
    user_data_dir="/home/<you>/my_chrome_profile",
    browser_type="chromium"
)
- Next time you run your code, it reuses that folder—preserving your session data, cookies, local storage, etc.
3. Using Managed Browsers in Crawl4AI
Once you have a data directory with your session data, pass it to BrowserConfig:

import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, BrowserConfig, CrawlerRunConfig

async def main():
    # 1) Reference your persistent data directory
    browser_config = BrowserConfig(
        headless=True,             # 'True' for automated runs
        verbose=True,
        use_managed_browser=True,  # Enables persistent browser strategy
        browser_type="chromium",
        user_data_dir="/path/to/my-chrome-profile"
    )

    # 2) Standard crawl config
    crawl_config = CrawlerRunConfig(
        wait_for="css:.logged-in-content"
    )

    async with AsyncWebCrawler(config=browser_config) as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(url="https://example.com/private", config=crawl_config)
        if result.success:
            print("Successfully accessed private data with your identity!")
        else:
            print("Error:", result.error_message)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Workflow
1. Login externally (via CLI or your normal Chrome with --user-data-dir=...).
2. Close that browser.
3. Use the same folder in user_data_dir= in Crawl4AI.
4. Crawl – The site sees your identity as if you’re the same user who just logged in.

4. Magic Mode: Simplified Automation
If you don’t need a persistent profile or identity-based approach, Magic Mode offers a quick way to simulate human-like browsing without storing long-term data.

from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig

async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
    result = await crawler.arun(
        url="https://example.com",
        config=CrawlerRunConfig(
            magic=True,  # Simplifies a lot of interaction
            remove_overlay_elements=True,
            page_timeout=60000
        )
    )
Magic Mode:

Simulates a user-like experience
Randomizes user agent & navigator
Randomizes interactions & timings
Masks automation signals
Attempts pop-up handling
But it’s no substitute for true user-based sessions if you want a fully legitimate identity-based solution.

5. Comparing Managed Browsers vs. Magic Mode
Feature	Managed Browsers	Magic Mode
Session Persistence	Full localStorage/cookies retained in user_data_dir	No persistent data (fresh each run)
Genuine Identity	Real user profile with full rights & preferences	Emulated user-like patterns, but no actual identity
Complex Sites	Best for login-gated sites or heavy config	Simple tasks, minimal login or config needed
Setup	External creation of user_data_dir, then use in Crawl4AI	Single-line approach (magic=True)
Reliability	Extremely consistent (same data across runs)	Good for smaller tasks, can be less stable
6. Summary
Create your user-data directory by launching Chrome/Chromium externally with --user-data-dir=/some/path.
Log in or configure sites as needed, then close the browser.
Reference that folder in BrowserConfig(user_data_dir="...") + use_managed_browser=True.
Enjoy persistent sessions that reflect your real identity.
If you only need quick, ephemeral automation, Magic Mode might suffice.
Recommended: Always prefer a Managed Browser for robust, identity-based crawling and simpler interactions with complex sites. Use Magic Mode for quick tasks or prototypes where persistent data is unnecessary.

With these approaches, you preserve your authentic browsing environment, ensuring the site sees you exactly as a normal user—no repeated logins or wasted time.
SSLCertificate Reference
The SSLCertificate class encapsulates an SSL certificate’s data and allows exporting it in various formats (PEM, DER, JSON, or text). It’s used within Crawl4AI whenever you set fetch_ssl_certificate=True in your CrawlerRunConfig.

1. Overview
Location: crawl4ai/ssl_certificate.py

class SSLCertificate:
    """
    Represents an SSL certificate with methods to export in various formats.

    Main Methods:
    - from_url(url, timeout=10)
    - from_file(file_path)
    - from_binary(binary_data)
    - to_json(filepath=None)
    - to_pem(filepath=None)
    - to_der(filepath=None)
    ...

    Common Properties:
    - issuer
    - subject
    - valid_from
    - valid_until
    - fingerprint
    """
Typical Use Case
You enable certificate fetching in your crawl by:
CrawlerRunConfig(fetch_ssl_certificate=True, ...)
After arun(), if result.ssl_certificate is present, it’s an instance of SSLCertificate.
You can read basic properties (issuer, subject, validity) or export them in multiple formats.
2. Construction & Fetching
2.1 from_url(url, timeout=10)
Manually load an SSL certificate from a given URL (port 443). Typically used internally, but you can call it directly if you want:

cert = SSLCertificate.from_url("https://example.com")
if cert:
    print("Fingerprint:", cert.fingerprint)
2.2 from_file(file_path)
Load from a file containing certificate data in ASN.1 or DER. Rarely needed unless you have local cert files:

cert = SSLCertificate.from_file("/path/to/cert.der")
2.3 from_binary(binary_data)
Initialize from raw binary. E.g., if you captured it from a socket or another source:

cert = SSLCertificate.from_binary(raw_bytes)
3. Common Properties
After obtaining a SSLCertificate instance (e.g. result.ssl_certificate from a crawl), you can read:

1. issuer (dict)
- E.g. {"CN": "My Root CA", "O": "..."} 2. subject (dict)
- E.g. {"CN": "example.com", "O": "ExampleOrg"} 3. valid_from (str)
- NotBefore date/time. Often in ASN.1/UTC format. 4. valid_until (str)
- NotAfter date/time. 5. fingerprint (str)
- The SHA-256 digest (lowercase hex).
- E.g. "d14d2e..."

4. Export Methods
Once you have a SSLCertificate object, you can export or inspect it:

4.1 to_json(filepath=None) → Optional[str]
Returns a JSON string containing the parsed certificate fields.
If filepath is provided, saves it to disk instead, returning None.
Usage:

json_data = cert.to_json()  # returns JSON string
cert.to_json("certificate.json")  # writes file, returns None
4.2 to_pem(filepath=None) → Optional[str]
Returns a PEM-encoded string (common for web servers).
If filepath is provided, saves it to disk instead.
pem_str = cert.to_pem()              # in-memory PEM string
cert.to_pem("/path/to/cert.pem")     # saved to file
4.3 to_der(filepath=None) → Optional[bytes]
Returns the original DER (binary ASN.1) bytes.
If filepath is specified, writes the bytes there instead.
der_bytes = cert.to_der()
cert.to_der("certificate.der")
4.4 (Optional) export_as_text()
If you see a method like export_as_text(), it typically returns an OpenSSL-style textual representation.
Not always needed, but can help for debugging or manual inspection.
5. Example Usage in Crawl4AI
Below is a minimal sample showing how the crawler obtains an SSL cert from a site, then reads or exports it. The code snippet:

import asyncio
import os
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig, CacheMode

async def main():
    tmp_dir = "tmp"
    os.makedirs(tmp_dir, exist_ok=True)

    config = CrawlerRunConfig(
        fetch_ssl_certificate=True,
        cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS
    )

    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun("https://example.com", config=config)
        if result.success and result.ssl_certificate:
            cert = result.ssl_certificate
            # 1. Basic Info
            print("Issuer CN:", cert.issuer.get("CN", ""))
            print("Valid until:", cert.valid_until)
            print("Fingerprint:", cert.fingerprint)

            # 2. Export
            cert.to_json(os.path.join(tmp_dir, "certificate.json"))
            cert.to_pem(os.path.join(tmp_dir, "certificate.pem"))
            cert.to_der(os.path.join(tmp_dir, "certificate.der"))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
6. Notes & Best Practices
1. Timeout: SSLCertificate.from_url internally uses a default 10s socket connect and wraps SSL.
2. Binary Form: The certificate is loaded in ASN.1 (DER) form, then re-parsed by OpenSSL.crypto.
3. Validation: This does not validate the certificate chain or trust store. It only fetches and parses.
4. Integration: Within Crawl4AI, you typically just set fetch_ssl_certificate=True in CrawlerRunConfig; the final result’s ssl_certificate is automatically built.
5. Export: If you need to store or analyze a cert, the to_json and to_pem are quite universal.

Summary
SSLCertificate is a convenience class for capturing and exporting the TLS certificate from your crawled site(s).
Common usage is in the CrawlResult.ssl_certificate field, accessible after setting fetch_ssl_certificate=True.
Offers quick access to essential certificate details (issuer, subject, fingerprint) and is easy to export (PEM, DER, JSON) for further analysis or server usage.
Use it whenever you need insight into a site’s certificate or require some form of cryptographic or compliance check.

Extracting JSON (No LLM)
One of Crawl4AI’s most powerful features is extracting structured JSON from websites without relying on large language models. By defining a schema with CSS or XPath selectors, you can extract data instantly—even from complex or nested HTML structures—without the cost, latency, or environmental impact of an LLM.

Why avoid LLM for basic extractions?

1. Faster & Cheaper: No API calls or GPU overhead.
2. Lower Carbon Footprint: LLM inference can be energy-intensive. A well-defined schema is practically carbon-free.
3. Precise & Repeatable: CSS/XPath selectors do exactly what you specify. LLM outputs can vary or hallucinate.
4. Scales Readily: For thousands of pages, schema-based extraction runs quickly and in parallel.

Below, we’ll explore how to craft these schemas and use them with JsonCssExtractionStrategy (or JsonXPathExtractionStrategy if you prefer XPath). We’ll also highlight advanced features like nested fields and base element attributes.

1. Intro to Schema-Based Extraction
A schema defines:

A base selector that identifies each “container” element on the page (e.g., a product row, a blog post card).
2. Fields describing which CSS/XPath selectors to use for each piece of data you want to capture (text, attribute, HTML block, etc.).
3. Nested or list types for repeated or hierarchical structures.
For example, if you have a list of products, each one might have a name, price, reviews, and “related products.” This approach is faster and more reliable than an LLM for consistent, structured pages.

2. Simple Example: Crypto Prices
Let’s begin with a simple schema-based extraction using the JsonCssExtractionStrategy. Below is a snippet that extracts cryptocurrency prices from a site (similar to the legacy Coinbase example). Notice we don’t call any LLM:

import json
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig, CacheMode
from crawl4ai.extraction_strategy import JsonCssExtractionStrategy

async def extract_crypto_prices():
    # 1. Define a simple extraction schema
    schema = {
        "name": "Crypto Prices",
        "baseSelector": "div.crypto-row",    # Repeated elements
        "fields": [
            {
                "name": "coin_name",
                "selector": "h2.coin-name",
                "type": "text"
            },
            {
                "name": "price",
                "selector": "span.coin-price",
                "type": "text"
            }
        ]
    }

    # 2. Create the extraction strategy
    extraction_strategy = JsonCssExtractionStrategy(schema, verbose=True)

    # 3. Set up your crawler config (if needed)
    config = CrawlerRunConfig(
        # e.g., pass js_code or wait_for if the page is dynamic
        # wait_for="css:.crypto-row:nth-child(20)"
        cache_mode = CacheMode.BYPASS,
        extraction_strategy=extraction_strategy,
    )

    async with AsyncWebCrawler(verbose=True) as crawler:
        # 4. Run the crawl and extraction
        result = await crawler.arun(
            url="https://example.com/crypto-prices",

            config=config
        )

        if not result.success:
            print("Crawl failed:", result.error_message)
            return

        # 5. Parse the extracted JSON
        data = json.loads(result.extracted_content)
        print(f"Extracted {len(data)} coin entries")
        print(json.dumps(data[0], indent=2) if data else "No data found")

asyncio.run(extract_crypto_prices())
Highlights:

baseSelector: Tells us where each “item” (crypto row) is.
fields: Two fields (coin_name, price) using simple CSS selectors.
Each field defines a type (e.g., text, attribute, html, regex, etc.).
No LLM is needed, and the performance is near-instant for hundreds or thousands of items.

XPath Example with raw:// HTML
Below is a short example demonstrating XPath extraction plus the raw:// scheme. We’ll pass a dummy HTML directly (no network request) and define the extraction strategy in CrawlerRunConfig.

import json
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig
from crawl4ai.extraction_strategy import JsonXPathExtractionStrategy

async def extract_crypto_prices_xpath():
    # 1. Minimal dummy HTML with some repeating rows
    dummy_html = """
    <html>
      <body>
        <div class='crypto-row'>
          <h2 class='coin-name'>Bitcoin</h2>
          <span class='coin-price'>$28,000</span>
        </div>
        <div class='crypto-row'>
          <h2 class='coin-name'>Ethereum</h2>
          <span class='coin-price'>$1,800</span>
        </div>
      </body>
    </html>
    """

    # 2. Define the JSON schema (XPath version)
    schema = {
        "name": "Crypto Prices via XPath",
        "baseSelector": "//div[@class='crypto-row']",
        "fields": [
            {
                "name": "coin_name",
                "selector": ".//h2[@class='coin-name']",
                "type": "text"
            },
            {
                "name": "price",
                "selector": ".//span[@class='coin-price']",
                "type": "text"
            }
        ]
    }

    # 3. Place the strategy in the CrawlerRunConfig
    config = CrawlerRunConfig(
        extraction_strategy=JsonXPathExtractionStrategy(schema, verbose=True)
    )

    # 4. Use raw:// scheme to pass dummy_html directly
    raw_url = f"raw://{dummy_html}"

    async with AsyncWebCrawler(verbose=True) as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(
            url=raw_url,
            config=config
        )

        if not result.success:
            print("Crawl failed:", result.error_message)
            return

        data = json.loads(result.extracted_content)
        print(f"Extracted {len(data)} coin rows")
        if data:
            print("First item:", data[0])

asyncio.run(extract_crypto_prices_xpath())
Key Points:

1. JsonXPathExtractionStrategy is used instead of JsonCssExtractionStrategy.
2. baseSelector and each field’s "selector" use XPath instead of CSS.
3. raw:// lets us pass dummy_html with no real network request—handy for local testing.
4. Everything (including the extraction strategy) is in CrawlerRunConfig.

That’s how you keep the config self-contained, illustrate XPath usage, and demonstrate the raw scheme for direct HTML input—all while avoiding the old approach of passing extraction_strategy directly to arun().

3. Advanced Schema & Nested Structures
Real sites often have nested or repeated data—like categories containing products, which themselves have a list of reviews or features. For that, we can define nested or list (and even nested_list) fields.

Sample E-Commerce HTML
We have a sample e-commerce HTML file on GitHub (example):

https://gist.githubusercontent.com/githubusercontent/2d7b8ba3cd8ab6cf3c8da771ddb36878/raw/1ae2f90c6861ce7dd84cc50d3df9920dee5e1fd2/sample_ecommerce.html
This snippet includes categories, products, features, reviews, and related items. Let’s see how to define a schema that fully captures that structure without LLM.
schema = {
    "name": "E-commerce Product Catalog",
    "baseSelector": "div.category",
    # (1) We can define optional baseFields if we want to extract attributes 
    # from the category container
    "baseFields": [
        {"name": "data_cat_id", "type": "attribute", "attribute": "data-cat-id"}, 
    ],
    "fields": [
        {
            "name": "category_name",
            "selector": "h2.category-name",
            "type": "text"
        },
        {
            "name": "products",
            "selector": "div.product",
            "type": "nested_list",    # repeated sub-objects
            "fields": [
                {
                    "name": "name",
                    "selector": "h3.product-name",
                    "type": "text"
                },
                {
                    "name": "price",
                    "selector": "p.product-price",
                    "type": "text"
                },
                {
                    "name": "details",
                    "selector": "div.product-details",
                    "type": "nested",  # single sub-object
                    "fields": [
                        {
                            "name": "brand",
                            "selector": "span.brand",
                            "type": "text"
                        },
                        {
                            "name": "model",
                            "selector": "span.model",
                            "type": "text"
                        }
                    ]
                },
                {
                    "name": "features",
                    "selector": "ul.product-features li",
                    "type": "list",
                    "fields": [
                        {"name": "feature", "type": "text"} 
                    ]
                },
                {
                    "name": "reviews",
                    "selector": "div.review",
                    "type": "nested_list",
                    "fields": [
                        {
                            "name": "reviewer", 
                            "selector": "span.reviewer", 
                            "type": "text"
                        },
                        {
                            "name": "rating", 
                            "selector": "span.rating", 
                            "type": "text"
                        },
                        {
                            "name": "comment", 
                            "selector": "p.review-text", 
                            "type": "text"
                        }
                    ]
                },
                {
                    "name": "related_products",
                    "selector": "ul.related-products li",
                    "type": "list",
                    "fields": [
                        {
                            "name": "name", 
                            "selector": "span.related-name", 
                            "type": "text"
                        },
                        {
                            "name": "price", 
                            "selector": "span.related-price", 
                            "type": "text"
                        }
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
Key Takeaways:

Nested vs. List:
type: "nested" means a single sub-object (like details).
type: "list" means multiple items that are simple dictionaries or single text fields.
type: "nested_list" means repeated complex objects (like products or reviews).
Base Fields: We can extract attributes from the container element via "baseFields". For instance, "data_cat_id" might be data-cat-id="elect123".
Transforms: We can also define a transform if we want to lower/upper case, strip whitespace, or even run a custom function.
Running the Extraction
import json
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig
from crawl4ai.extraction_strategy import JsonCssExtractionStrategy

ecommerce_schema = {
    # ... the advanced schema from above ...
}

async def extract_ecommerce_data():
    strategy = JsonCssExtractionStrategy(ecommerce_schema, verbose=True)

    config = CrawlerRunConfig()

    async with AsyncWebCrawler(verbose=True) as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(
            url="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/githubusercontent/2d7b8ba3cd8ab6cf3c8da771ddb36878/raw/1ae2f90c6861ce7dd84cc50d3df9920dee5e1fd2/sample_ecommerce.html",
            extraction_strategy=strategy,
            config=config
        )

        if not result.success:
            print("Crawl failed:", result.error_message)
            return

        # Parse the JSON output
        data = json.loads(result.extracted_content)
        print(json.dumps(data, indent=2) if data else "No data found.")

asyncio.run(extract_ecommerce_data())
If all goes well, you get a structured JSON array with each “category,” containing an array of products. Each product includes details, features, reviews, etc. All of that without an LLM.

4. Why “No LLM” Is Often Better
1. Zero Hallucination: Schema-based extraction doesn’t guess text. It either finds it or not.
2. Guaranteed Structure: The same schema yields consistent JSON across many pages, so your downstream pipeline can rely on stable keys.
3. Speed: LLM-based extraction can be 10–1000x slower for large-scale crawling.
4. Scalable: Adding or updating a field is a matter of adjusting the schema, not re-tuning a model.

When might you consider an LLM? Possibly if the site is extremely unstructured or you want AI summarization. But always try a schema approach first for repeated or consistent data patterns.

5. Base Element Attributes & Additional Fields
It’s easy to extract attributes (like href, src, or data-xxx) from your base or nested elements using:

{
  "name": "href",
  "type": "attribute",
  "attribute": "href",
  "default": null
}
You can define them in baseFields (extracted from the main container element) or in each field’s sub-lists. This is especially helpful if you need an item’s link or ID stored in the parent <div>.

6. Putting It All Together: Larger Example
Consider a blog site. We have a schema that extracts the URL from each post card (via baseFields with an "attribute": "href"), plus the title, date, summary, and author:

schema = {
  "name": "Blog Posts",
  "baseSelector": "a.blog-post-card",
  "baseFields": [
    {"name": "post_url", "type": "attribute", "attribute": "href"}
  ],
  "fields": [
    {"name": "title", "selector": "h2.post-title", "type": "text", "default": "No Title"},
    {"name": "date", "selector": "time.post-date", "type": "text", "default": ""},
    {"name": "summary", "selector": "p.post-summary", "type": "text", "default": ""},
    {"name": "author", "selector": "span.post-author", "type": "text", "default": ""}
  ]
}
Then run with JsonCssExtractionStrategy(schema) to get an array of blog post objects, each with "post_url", "title", "date", "summary", "author".

7. Tips & Best Practices
1. Inspect the DOM in Chrome DevTools or Firefox’s Inspector to find stable selectors.
2. Start Simple: Verify you can extract a single field. Then add complexity like nested objects or lists.
3. Test your schema on partial HTML or a test page before a big crawl.
4. Combine with JS Execution if the site loads content dynamically. You can pass js_code or wait_for in CrawlerRunConfig.
5. Look at Logs when verbose=True: if your selectors are off or your schema is malformed, it’ll often show warnings.
6. Use baseFields if you need attributes from the container element (e.g., href, data-id), especially for the “parent” item.
7. Performance: For large pages, make sure your selectors are as narrow as possible.

8. Schema Generation Utility
While manually crafting schemas is powerful and precise, Crawl4AI now offers a convenient utility to automatically generate extraction schemas using LLM. This is particularly useful when:

You're dealing with a new website structure and want a quick starting point
You need to extract complex nested data structures
You want to avoid the learning curve of CSS/XPath selector syntax
Using the Schema Generator
The schema generator is available as a static method on both JsonCssExtractionStrategy and JsonXPathExtractionStrategy. You can choose between OpenAI's GPT-4 or the open-source Ollama for schema generation:

from crawl4ai.extraction_strategy import JsonCssExtractionStrategy, JsonXPathExtractionStrategy

# Sample HTML with product information
html = """
<div class="product-card">
    <h2 class="title">Gaming Laptop</h2>
    <div class="price">$999.99</div>
    <div class="specs">
        <ul>
            <li>16GB RAM</li>
            <li>1TB SSD</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</div>
"""

# Option 1: Using OpenAI (requires API token)
css_schema = JsonCssExtractionStrategy.generate_schema(
    html,
    schema_type="css",  # This is the default
    llm_provider="openai/gpt-4o",  # Default provider
    api_token="your-openai-token"  # Required for OpenAI
)

# Option 2: Using Ollama (open source, no token needed)
xpath_schema = JsonXPathExtractionStrategy.generate_schema(
    html,
    schema_type="xpath",
    llm_provider="ollama/llama3.3",  # Open source alternative
    api_token=None  # Not needed for Ollama
)

# Use the generated schema for fast, repeated extractions
strategy = JsonCssExtractionStrategy(css_schema)
LLM Provider Options
OpenAI GPT-4 (openai/gpt4o)
Default provider
Requires an API token
Generally provides more accurate schemas
Set via environment variable: OPENAI_API_KEY

Ollama (ollama/llama3.3)

Open source alternative
No API token required
Self-hosted option
Good for development and testing
Benefits of Schema Generation
One-Time Cost: While schema generation uses LLM, it's a one-time cost. The generated schema can be reused for unlimited extractions without further LLM calls.
Smart Pattern Recognition: The LLM analyzes the HTML structure and identifies common patterns, often producing more robust selectors than manual attempts.
Automatic Nesting: Complex nested structures are automatically detected and properly represented in the schema.
Learning Tool: The generated schemas serve as excellent examples for learning how to write your own schemas.
Best Practices
Review Generated Schemas: While the generator is smart, always review and test the generated schema before using it in production.
Provide Representative HTML: The better your sample HTML represents the overall structure, the more accurate the generated schema will be.
Consider Both CSS and XPath: Try both schema types and choose the one that works best for your specific case.
Cache Generated Schemas: Since generation uses LLM, save successful schemas for reuse.
API Token Security: Never hardcode API tokens. Use environment variables or secure configuration management.
Choose Provider Wisely:
Use OpenAI for production-quality schemas
Use Ollama for development, testing, or when you need a self-hosted solution
That's it for Extracting JSON (No LLM)! You've seen how schema-based approaches (either CSS or XPath) can handle everything from simple lists to deeply nested product catalogs—instantly, with minimal overhead. Enjoy building robust scrapers that produce consistent, structured JSON for your data pipelines!

9. Conclusion
With JsonCssExtractionStrategy (or JsonXPathExtractionStrategy), you can build powerful, LLM-free pipelines that:

Scrape any consistent site for structured data.
Support nested objects, repeating lists, or advanced transformations.
Scale to thousands of pages quickly and reliably.
Next Steps:

Combine your extracted JSON with advanced filtering or summarization in a second pass if needed.
For dynamic pages, combine strategies with js_code or infinite scroll hooking to ensure all content is loaded.
Remember: For repeated, structured data, you don’t need to pay for or wait on an LLM. A well-crafted schema plus CSS or XPath gets you the data faster, cleaner, and cheaper—the real power of Crawl4AI.

That’s it for Extracting JSON (No LLM)! You’ve seen how schema-based approaches (either CSS or XPath) can handle everything from simple lists to deeply nested product catalogs—instantly, with minimal overhead. Enjoy building robust scrapers that produce consistent, structured JSON for your data pipelines!

Extracting JSON (LLM)
In some cases, you need to extract complex or unstructured information from a webpage that a simple CSS/XPath schema cannot easily parse. Or you want AI-driven insights, classification, or summarization. For these scenarios, Crawl4AI provides an LLM-based extraction strategy that:

Works with any large language model supported by LightLLM (Ollama, OpenAI, Claude, and more).
Automatically splits content into chunks (if desired) to handle token limits, then combines results.
Lets you define a schema (like a Pydantic model) or a simpler “block” extraction approach.
Important: LLM-based extraction can be slower and costlier than schema-based approaches. If your page data is highly structured, consider using JsonCssExtractionStrategy or JsonXPathExtractionStrategy first. But if you need AI to interpret or reorganize content, read on!

1. Why Use an LLM?
Complex Reasoning: If the site’s data is unstructured, scattered, or full of natural language context.
Semantic Extraction: Summaries, knowledge graphs, or relational data that require comprehension.
Flexible: You can pass instructions to the model to do more advanced transformations or classification.
2. Provider-Agnostic via LightLLM
Crawl4AI uses a “provider string” (e.g., "openai/gpt-4o", "ollama/llama2.0", "aws/titan") to identify your LLM. Any model that LightLLM supports is fair game. You just provide:

provider: The <provider>/<model_name> identifier (e.g., "openai/gpt-4", "ollama/llama2", "huggingface/google-flan", etc.).
api_token: If needed (for OpenAI, HuggingFace, etc.); local models or Ollama might not require it.
api_base (optional): If your provider has a custom endpoint.
This means you aren’t locked into a single LLM vendor. Switch or experiment easily.

3. How LLM Extraction Works
3.1 Flow
1. Chunking (optional): The HTML or markdown is split into smaller segments if it’s very long (based on chunk_token_threshold, overlap, etc.).
2. Prompt Construction: For each chunk, the library forms a prompt that includes your instruction (and possibly schema or examples).
3. LLM Inference: Each chunk is sent to the model in parallel or sequentially (depending on your concurrency).
4. Combining: The results from each chunk are merged and parsed into JSON.

3.2 extraction_type
"schema": The model tries to return JSON conforming to your Pydantic-based schema.
"block": The model returns freeform text, or smaller JSON structures, which the library collects.
For structured data, "schema" is recommended. You provide schema=YourPydanticModel.model_json_schema().

4. Key Parameters
Below is an overview of important LLM extraction parameters. All are typically set inside LLMExtractionStrategy(...). You then put that strategy in your CrawlerRunConfig(..., extraction_strategy=...).

1. provider (str): e.g., "openai/gpt-4", "ollama/llama2".
2. api_token (str): The API key or token for that model. May not be needed for local models.
3. schema (dict): A JSON schema describing the fields you want. Usually generated by YourModel.model_json_schema().
4. extraction_type (str): "schema" or "block".
5. instruction (str): Prompt text telling the LLM what you want extracted. E.g., “Extract these fields as a JSON array.”
6. chunk_token_threshold (int): Maximum tokens per chunk. If your content is huge, you can break it up for the LLM.
7. overlap_rate (float): Overlap ratio between adjacent chunks. E.g., 0.1 means 10% of each chunk is repeated to preserve context continuity.
8. apply_chunking (bool): Set True to chunk automatically. If you want a single pass, set False.
9. input_format (str): Determines which crawler result is passed to the LLM. Options include:
- "markdown": The raw markdown (default).
- "fit_markdown": The filtered “fit” markdown if you used a content filter.
- "html": The cleaned or raw HTML.
10. extra_args (dict): Additional LLM parameters like temperature, max_tokens, top_p, etc.
11. show_usage(): A method you can call to print out usage info (token usage per chunk, total cost if known).

Example:

extraction_strategy = LLMExtractionStrategy(
    provider="openai/gpt-4",
    api_token="YOUR_OPENAI_KEY",
    schema=MyModel.model_json_schema(),
    extraction_type="schema",
    instruction="Extract a list of items from the text with 'name' and 'price' fields.",
    chunk_token_threshold=1200,
    overlap_rate=0.1,
    apply_chunking=True,
    input_format="html",
    extra_args={"temperature": 0.1, "max_tokens": 1000},
    verbose=True
)
5. Putting It in CrawlerRunConfig
Important: In Crawl4AI, all strategy definitions should go inside the CrawlerRunConfig, not directly as a param in arun(). Here’s a full example:

import os
import asyncio
import json
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import List
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, BrowserConfig, CrawlerRunConfig, CacheMode
from crawl4ai.extraction_strategy import LLMExtractionStrategy

class Product(BaseModel):
    name: str
    price: str

async def main():
    # 1. Define the LLM extraction strategy
    llm_strategy = LLMExtractionStrategy(
        provider="openai/gpt-4o-mini",            # e.g. "ollama/llama2"
        api_token=os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY'),
        schema=Product.schema_json(),            # Or use model_json_schema()
        extraction_type="schema",
        instruction="Extract all product objects with 'name' and 'price' from the content.",
        chunk_token_threshold=1000,
        overlap_rate=0.0,
        apply_chunking=True,
        input_format="markdown",   # or "html", "fit_markdown"
        extra_args={"temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 800}
    )

    # 2. Build the crawler config
    crawl_config = CrawlerRunConfig(
        extraction_strategy=llm_strategy,
        cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS
    )

    # 3. Create a browser config if needed
    browser_cfg = BrowserConfig(headless=True)

    async with AsyncWebCrawler(config=browser_cfg) as crawler:
        # 4. Let's say we want to crawl a single page
        result = await crawler.arun(
            url="https://example.com/products",
            config=crawl_config
        )

        if result.success:
            # 5. The extracted content is presumably JSON
            data = json.loads(result.extracted_content)
            print("Extracted items:", data)

            # 6. Show usage stats
            llm_strategy.show_usage()  # prints token usage
        else:
            print("Error:", result.error_message)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
6. Chunking Details
6.1 chunk_token_threshold
If your page is large, you might exceed your LLM’s context window. chunk_token_threshold sets the approximate max tokens per chunk. The library calculates word→token ratio using word_token_rate (often ~0.75 by default). If chunking is enabled (apply_chunking=True), the text is split into segments.

6.2 overlap_rate
To keep context continuous across chunks, we can overlap them. E.g., overlap_rate=0.1 means each subsequent chunk includes 10% of the previous chunk’s text. This is helpful if your needed info might straddle chunk boundaries.

6.3 Performance & Parallelism
By chunking, you can potentially process multiple chunks in parallel (depending on your concurrency settings and the LLM provider). This reduces total time if the site is huge or has many sections.

7. Input Format
By default, LLMExtractionStrategy uses input_format="markdown", meaning the crawler’s final markdown is fed to the LLM. You can change to:

html: The cleaned HTML or raw HTML (depending on your crawler config) goes into the LLM.
fit_markdown: If you used, for instance, PruningContentFilter, the “fit” version of the markdown is used. This can drastically reduce tokens if you trust the filter.
markdown: Standard markdown output from the crawler’s markdown_generator.
This setting is crucial: if the LLM instructions rely on HTML tags, pick "html". If you prefer a text-based approach, pick "markdown".

LLMExtractionStrategy(
    # ...
    input_format="html",  # Instead of "markdown" or "fit_markdown"
)
8. Token Usage & Show Usage
To keep track of tokens and cost, each chunk is processed with an LLM call. We record usage in:

usages (list): token usage per chunk or call.
total_usage: sum of all chunk calls.
show_usage(): prints a usage report (if the provider returns usage data).
llm_strategy = LLMExtractionStrategy(...)
# ...
llm_strategy.show_usage()
# e.g. “Total usage: 1241 tokens across 2 chunk calls”
If your model provider doesn’t return usage info, these fields might be partial or empty.

9. Example: Building a Knowledge Graph
Below is a snippet combining LLMExtractionStrategy with a Pydantic schema for a knowledge graph. Notice how we pass an instruction telling the model what to parse.

import os
import json
import asyncio
from typing import List
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, BrowserConfig, CrawlerRunConfig, CacheMode
from crawl4ai.extraction_strategy import LLMExtractionStrategy

class Entity(BaseModel):
    name: str
    description: str

class Relationship(BaseModel):
    entity1: Entity
    entity2: Entity
    description: str
    relation_type: str

class KnowledgeGraph(BaseModel):
    entities: List[Entity]
    relationships: List[Relationship]

async def main():
    # LLM extraction strategy
    llm_strat = LLMExtractionStrategy(
        provider="openai/gpt-4",
        api_token=os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY'),
        schema=KnowledgeGraph.schema_json(),
        extraction_type="schema",
        instruction="Extract entities and relationships from the content. Return valid JSON.",
        chunk_token_threshold=1400,
        apply_chunking=True,
        input_format="html",
        extra_args={"temperature": 0.1, "max_tokens": 1500}
    )

    crawl_config = CrawlerRunConfig(
        extraction_strategy=llm_strat,
        cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS
    )

    async with AsyncWebCrawler(config=BrowserConfig(headless=True)) as crawler:
        # Example page
        url = "https://www.nbcnews.com/business"
        result = await crawler.arun(url=url, config=crawl_config)

        if result.success:
            with open("kb_result.json", "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
                f.write(result.extracted_content)
            llm_strat.show_usage()
        else:
            print("Crawl failed:", result.error_message)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Key Observations:

extraction_type="schema" ensures we get JSON fitting our KnowledgeGraph.
input_format="html" means we feed HTML to the model.
instruction guides the model to output a structured knowledge graph.
10. Best Practices & Caveats
1. Cost & Latency: LLM calls can be slow or expensive. Consider chunking or smaller coverage if you only need partial data.
2. Model Token Limits: If your page + instruction exceed the context window, chunking is essential.
3. Instruction Engineering: Well-crafted instructions can drastically improve output reliability.
4. Schema Strictness: "schema" extraction tries to parse the model output as JSON. If the model returns invalid JSON, partial extraction might happen, or you might get an error.
5. Parallel vs. Serial: The library can process multiple chunks in parallel, but you must watch out for rate limits on certain providers.
6. Check Output: Sometimes, an LLM might omit fields or produce extraneous text. You may want to post-validate with Pydantic or do additional cleanup.

11. Conclusion
LLM-based extraction in Crawl4AI is provider-agnostic, letting you choose from hundreds of models via LightLLM. It’s perfect for semantically complex tasks or generating advanced structures like knowledge graphs. However, it’s slower and potentially costlier than schema-based approaches. Keep these tips in mind:

Put your LLM strategy in CrawlerRunConfig.
Use input_format to pick which form (markdown, HTML, fit_markdown) the LLM sees.
Tweak chunk_token_threshold, overlap_rate, and apply_chunking to handle large content efficiently.
Monitor token usage with show_usage().
If your site’s data is consistent or repetitive, consider JsonCssExtractionStrategy first for speed and simplicity. But if you need an AI-driven approach, LLMExtractionStrategy offers a flexible, multi-provider solution for extracting structured JSON from any website.

Next Steps:

1. Experiment with Different Providers
- Try switching the provider (e.g., "ollama/llama2", "openai/gpt-4o", etc.) to see differences in speed, accuracy, or cost.
- Pass different extra_args like temperature, top_p, and max_tokens to fine-tune your results.

2. Performance Tuning
- If pages are large, tweak chunk_token_threshold, overlap_rate, or apply_chunking to optimize throughput.
- Check the usage logs with show_usage() to keep an eye on token consumption and identify potential bottlenecks.

3. Validate Outputs
- If using extraction_type="schema", parse the LLM’s JSON with a Pydantic model for a final validation step.
- Log or handle any parse errors gracefully, especially if the model occasionally returns malformed JSON.

4. Explore Hooks & Automation
- Integrate LLM extraction with hooks for complex pre/post-processing.
- Use a multi-step pipeline: crawl, filter, LLM-extract, then store or index results for further analysis.

That’s it for Extracting JSON (LLM)—now you can harness AI to parse, classify, or reorganize data on the web. Happy crawling!

Cosine Strategy
The Cosine Strategy in Crawl4AI uses similarity-based clustering to identify and extract relevant content sections from web pages. This strategy is particularly useful when you need to find and extract content based on semantic similarity rather than structural patterns.

How It Works
The Cosine Strategy: 1. Breaks down page content into meaningful chunks 2. Converts text into vector representations 3. Calculates similarity between chunks 4. Clusters similar content together 5. Ranks and filters content based on relevance

Basic Usage
from crawl4ai.extraction_strategy import CosineStrategy

strategy = CosineStrategy(
    semantic_filter="product reviews",    # Target content type
    word_count_threshold=10,             # Minimum words per cluster
    sim_threshold=0.3                    # Similarity threshold
)

async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
    result = await crawler.arun(
        url="https://example.com/reviews",
        extraction_strategy=strategy
    )

    content = result.extracted_content
Configuration Options
Core Parameters
CosineStrategy(
    # Content Filtering
    semantic_filter: str = None,       # Keywords/topic for content filtering
    word_count_threshold: int = 10,    # Minimum words per cluster
    sim_threshold: float = 0.3,        # Similarity threshold (0.0 to 1.0)

    # Clustering Parameters
    max_dist: float = 0.2,            # Maximum distance for clustering
    linkage_method: str = 'ward',      # Clustering linkage method
    top_k: int = 3,                   # Number of top categories to extract

    # Model Configuration
    model_name: str = 'sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2',  # Embedding model

    verbose: bool = False             # Enable logging
)
Parameter Details
1. semantic_filter - Sets the target topic or content type - Use keywords relevant to your desired content - Example: "technical specifications", "user reviews", "pricing information"

2. sim_threshold - Controls how similar content must be to be grouped together - Higher values (e.g., 0.8) mean stricter matching - Lower values (e.g., 0.3) allow more variation

# Strict matching
strategy = CosineStrategy(sim_threshold=0.8)

# Loose matching
strategy = CosineStrategy(sim_threshold=0.3)
3. word_count_threshold - Filters out short content blocks - Helps eliminate noise and irrelevant content

# Only consider substantial paragraphs
strategy = CosineStrategy(word_count_threshold=50)
4. top_k - Number of top content clusters to return - Higher values return more diverse content

# Get top 5 most relevant content clusters
strategy = CosineStrategy(top_k=5)
Use Cases
1. Article Content Extraction
strategy = CosineStrategy(
    semantic_filter="main article content",
    word_count_threshold=100,  # Longer blocks for articles
    top_k=1                   # Usually want single main content
)

result = await crawler.arun(
    url="https://example.com/blog/post",
    extraction_strategy=strategy
)
2. Product Review Analysis
strategy = CosineStrategy(
    semantic_filter="customer reviews and ratings",
    word_count_threshold=20,   # Reviews can be shorter
    top_k=10,                 # Get multiple reviews
    sim_threshold=0.4         # Allow variety in review content
)
3. Technical Documentation
strategy = CosineStrategy(
    semantic_filter="technical specifications documentation",
    word_count_threshold=30,
    sim_threshold=0.6,        # Stricter matching for technical content
    max_dist=0.3             # Allow related technical sections
)
Advanced Features
Custom Clustering
strategy = CosineStrategy(
    linkage_method='complete',  # Alternative clustering method
    max_dist=0.4,              # Larger clusters
    model_name='sentence-transformers/paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2'  # Multilingual support
)
Content Filtering Pipeline
strategy = CosineStrategy(
    semantic_filter="pricing plans features",
    word_count_threshold=15,
    sim_threshold=0.5,
    top_k=3
)

async def extract_pricing_features(url: str):
    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(
            url=url,
            extraction_strategy=strategy
        )

        if result.success:
            content = json.loads(result.extracted_content)
            return {
                'pricing_features': content,
                'clusters': len(content),
                'similarity_scores': [item['score'] for item in content]
            }
Best Practices
1. Adjust Thresholds Iteratively - Start with default values - Adjust based on results - Monitor clustering quality

2. Choose Appropriate Word Count Thresholds - Higher for articles (100+) - Lower for reviews/comments (20+) - Medium for product descriptions (50+)

3. Optimize Performance

strategy = CosineStrategy(
    word_count_threshold=10,  # Filter early
    top_k=5,                 # Limit results
    verbose=True             # Monitor performance
)
4. Handle Different Content Types

# For mixed content pages
strategy = CosineStrategy(
    semantic_filter="product features",
    sim_threshold=0.4,      # More flexible matching
    max_dist=0.3,          # Larger clusters
    top_k=3                # Multiple relevant sections
)
Error Handling
try:
    result = await crawler.arun(
        url="https://example.com",
        extraction_strategy=strategy
    )

    if result.success:
        content = json.loads(result.extracted_content)
        if not content:
            print("No relevant content found")
    else:
        print(f"Extraction failed: {result.error_message}")

except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error during extraction: {str(e)}")
The Cosine Strategy is particularly effective when: - Content structure is inconsistent - You need semantic understanding - You want to find similar content blocks - Structure-based extraction (CSS/XPath) isn't reliable

It works well with other strategies and can be used as a pre-processing step for LLM-based extraction.

Chunking Strategies
Chunking strategies are critical for dividing large texts into manageable parts, enabling effective content processing and extraction. These strategies are foundational in cosine similarity-based extraction techniques, which allow users to retrieve only the most relevant chunks of content for a given query. Additionally, they facilitate direct integration into RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems for structured and scalable workflows.

Why Use Chunking?
1. Cosine Similarity and Query Relevance: Prepares chunks for semantic similarity analysis. 2. RAG System Integration: Seamlessly processes and stores chunks for retrieval. 3. Structured Processing: Allows for diverse segmentation methods, such as sentence-based, topic-based, or windowed approaches.

Methods of Chunking
1. Regex-Based Chunking
Splits text based on regular expression patterns, useful for coarse segmentation.

Code Example:

class RegexChunking:
    def __init__(self, patterns=None):
        self.patterns = patterns or [r'\n\n']  # Default pattern for paragraphs

    def chunk(self, text):
        paragraphs = [text]
        for pattern in self.patterns:
            paragraphs = [seg for p in paragraphs for seg in re.split(pattern, p)]
        return paragraphs

# Example Usage
text = """This is the first paragraph.

This is the second paragraph."""
chunker = RegexChunking()
print(chunker.chunk(text))
2. Sentence-Based Chunking
Divides text into sentences using NLP tools, ideal for extracting meaningful statements.

Code Example:

from nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize

class NlpSentenceChunking:
    def chunk(self, text):
        sentences = sent_tokenize(text)
        return [sentence.strip() for sentence in sentences]

# Example Usage
text = "This is sentence one. This is sentence two."
chunker = NlpSentenceChunking()
print(chunker.chunk(text))
3. Topic-Based Segmentation
Uses algorithms like TextTiling to create topic-coherent chunks.

Code Example:

from nltk.tokenize import TextTilingTokenizer

class TopicSegmentationChunking:
    def __init__(self):
        self.tokenizer = TextTilingTokenizer()

    def chunk(self, text):
        return self.tokenizer.tokenize(text)

# Example Usage
text = """This is an introduction.
This is a detailed discussion on the topic."""
chunker = TopicSegmentationChunking()
print(chunker.chunk(text))
4. Fixed-Length Word Chunking
Segments text into chunks of a fixed word count.

Code Example:

class FixedLengthWordChunking:
    def __init__(self, chunk_size=100):
        self.chunk_size = chunk_size

    def chunk(self, text):
        words = text.split()
        return [' '.join(words[i:i + self.chunk_size]) for i in range(0, len(words), self.chunk_size)]

# Example Usage
text = "This is a long text with many words to be chunked into fixed sizes."
chunker = FixedLengthWordChunking(chunk_size=5)
print(chunker.chunk(text))
5. Sliding Window Chunking
Generates overlapping chunks for better contextual coherence.

Code Example:

class SlidingWindowChunking:
    def __init__(self, window_size=100, step=50):
        self.window_size = window_size
        self.step = step

    def chunk(self, text):
        words = text.split()
        chunks = []
        for i in range(0, len(words) - self.window_size + 1, self.step):
            chunks.append(' '.join(words[i:i + self.window_size]))
        return chunks

# Example Usage
text = "This is a long text to demonstrate sliding window chunking."
chunker = SlidingWindowChunking(window_size=5, step=2)
print(chunker.chunk(text))
Combining Chunking with Cosine Similarity
To enhance the relevance of extracted content, chunking strategies can be paired with cosine similarity techniques. Here’s an example workflow:

Code Example:

from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

class CosineSimilarityExtractor:
    def __init__(self, query):
        self.query = query
        self.vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()

    def find_relevant_chunks(self, chunks):
        vectors = self.vectorizer.fit_transform([self.query] + chunks)
        similarities = cosine_similarity(vectors[0:1], vectors[1:]).flatten()
        return [(chunks[i], similarities[i]) for i in range(len(chunks))]

# Example Workflow
text = """This is a sample document. It has multiple sentences. 
We are testing chunking and similarity."""

chunker = SlidingWindowChunking(window_size=5, step=3)
chunks = chunker.chunk(text)
query = "testing chunking"
extractor = CosineSimilarityExtractor(query)
relevant_chunks = extractor.find_relevant_chunks(chunks)

print(relevant_chunks)

AsyncWebCrawler
The AsyncWebCrawler is the core class for asynchronous web crawling in Crawl4AI. You typically create it once, optionally customize it with a BrowserConfig (e.g., headless, user agent), then run multiple arun() calls with different CrawlerRunConfig objects.

Recommended usage:

1. Create a BrowserConfig for global browser settings. 

2. Instantiate AsyncWebCrawler(config=browser_config). 

3. Use the crawler in an async context manager (async with) or manage start/close manually. 

4. Call arun(url, config=crawler_run_config) for each page you want.

1. Constructor Overview
class AsyncWebCrawler:
    def __init__(
        self,
        crawler_strategy: Optional[AsyncCrawlerStrategy] = None,
        config: Optional[BrowserConfig] = None,
        always_bypass_cache: bool = False,           # deprecated
        always_by_pass_cache: Optional[bool] = None, # also deprecated
        base_directory: str = ...,
        thread_safe: bool = False,
        **kwargs,
    ):
        """
        Create an AsyncWebCrawler instance.

        Args:
            crawler_strategy: 
                (Advanced) Provide a custom crawler strategy if needed.
            config: 
                A BrowserConfig object specifying how the browser is set up.
            always_bypass_cache: 
                (Deprecated) Use CrawlerRunConfig.cache_mode instead.
            base_directory:

                If True, attempts some concurrency safeguards. Usually False.
            **kwargs: 
                Additional legacy or debugging parameters.
        """
    )

### Typical Initialization

```python
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, BrowserConfig

browser_cfg = BrowserConfig(
    browser_type="chromium",
    headless=True,
    verbose=True
)

crawler = AsyncWebCrawler(config=browser_cfg)
Notes:

Legacy parameters like always_bypass_cache remain for backward compatibility, but prefer to set caching in CrawlerRunConfig.
2. Lifecycle: Start/Close or Context Manager
2.1 Context Manager (Recommended)
async with AsyncWebCrawler(config=browser_cfg) as crawler:
    result = await crawler.arun("https://example.com")
    # The crawler automatically starts/closes resources
When the async with block ends, the crawler cleans up (closes the browser, etc.).

2.2 Manual Start & Close
crawler = AsyncWebCrawler(config=browser_cfg)
await crawler.start()

result1 = await crawler.arun("https://example.com")
result2 = await crawler.arun("https://another.com")

await crawler.close()
Use this style if you have a long-running application or need full control of the crawler’s lifecycle.

3. Primary Method: arun()
async def arun(
    self,
    url: str,
    config: Optional[CrawlerRunConfig] = None,
    # Legacy parameters for backward compatibility...
) -> CrawlResult:
    ...
3.1 New Approach
You pass a CrawlerRunConfig object that sets up everything about a crawl—content filtering, caching, session reuse, JS code, screenshots, etc.

import asyncio
from crawl4ai import CrawlerRunConfig, CacheMode

run_cfg = CrawlerRunConfig(
    cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS,
    css_selector="main.article",
    word_count_threshold=10,
    screenshot=True
)

async with AsyncWebCrawler(config=browser_cfg) as crawler:
    result = await crawler.arun("https://example.com/news", config=run_cfg)
    print("Crawled HTML length:", len(result.cleaned_html))
    if result.screenshot:
        print("Screenshot base64 length:", len(result.screenshot))
3.2 Legacy Parameters Still Accepted
For backward compatibility, arun() can still accept direct arguments like css_selector=..., word_count_threshold=..., etc., but we strongly advise migrating them into a CrawlerRunConfig.

4. Batch Processing: arun_many()
async def arun_many(
    self,
    urls: List[str],
    config: Optional[CrawlerRunConfig] = None,
    # Legacy parameters maintained for backwards compatibility...
) -> List[CrawlResult]:
    """
    Process multiple URLs with intelligent rate limiting and resource monitoring.
    """
4.1 Resource-Aware Crawling
The arun_many() method now uses an intelligent dispatcher that:

Monitors system memory usage
Implements adaptive rate limiting
Provides detailed progress monitoring
Manages concurrent crawls efficiently
4.2 Example Usage
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, BrowserConfig, CrawlerRunConfig, RateLimitConfig
from crawl4ai.dispatcher import DisplayMode

# Configure browser
browser_cfg = BrowserConfig(headless=True)

# Configure crawler with rate limiting
run_cfg = CrawlerRunConfig(
    # Enable rate limiting
    enable_rate_limiting=True,
    rate_limit_config=RateLimitConfig(
        base_delay=(1.0, 2.0),  # Random delay between 1-2 seconds
        max_delay=30.0,         # Maximum delay after rate limit hits
        max_retries=2,          # Number of retries before giving up
        rate_limit_codes=[429, 503]  # Status codes that trigger rate limiting
    ),
    # Resource monitoring
    memory_threshold_percent=70.0,  # Pause if memory exceeds this
    check_interval=0.5,            # How often to check resources
    max_session_permit=3,          # Maximum concurrent crawls
    display_mode=DisplayMode.DETAILED.value  # Show detailed progress
)

urls = [
    "https://example.com/page1",
    "https://example.com/page2",
    "https://example.com/page3"
]

async with AsyncWebCrawler(config=browser_cfg) as crawler:
    results = await crawler.arun_many(urls, config=run_cfg)
    for result in results:
        print(f"URL: {result.url}, Success: {result.success}")
4.3 Key Features
1. Rate Limiting

Automatic delay between requests
Exponential backoff on rate limit detection
Domain-specific rate limiting
Configurable retry strategy
2. Resource Monitoring

Memory usage tracking
Adaptive concurrency based on system load
Automatic pausing when resources are constrained
3. Progress Monitoring

Detailed or aggregated progress display
Real-time status updates
Memory usage statistics
4. Error Handling

Graceful handling of rate limits
Automatic retries with backoff
Detailed error reporting
5. CrawlResult Output
Each arun() returns a CrawlResult containing:

url: Final URL (if redirected).
html: Original HTML.
cleaned_html: Sanitized HTML.
markdown_v2 (or future markdown): Markdown outputs (raw, fit, etc.).
extracted_content: If an extraction strategy was used (JSON for CSS/LLM strategies).
screenshot, pdf: If screenshots/PDF requested.
media, links: Information about discovered images/links.
success, error_message: Status info.
For details, see CrawlResult doc.

6. Quick Example
Below is an example hooking it all together:

import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, BrowserConfig, CrawlerRunConfig, CacheMode
from crawl4ai.extraction_strategy import JsonCssExtractionStrategy
import json

async def main():
    # 1. Browser config
    browser_cfg = BrowserConfig(
        browser_type="firefox",
        headless=False,
        verbose=True
    )

    # 2. Run config
    schema = {
        "name": "Articles",
        "baseSelector": "article.post",
        "fields": [
            {
                "name": "title", 
                "selector": "h2", 
                "type": "text"
            },
            {
                "name": "url", 
                "selector": "a", 
                "type": "attribute", 
                "attribute": "href"
            }
        ]
    }

    run_cfg = CrawlerRunConfig(
        cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS,
        extraction_strategy=JsonCssExtractionStrategy(schema),
        word_count_threshold=15,
        remove_overlay_elements=True,
        wait_for="css:.post"  # Wait for posts to appear
    )

    async with AsyncWebCrawler(config=browser_cfg) as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(
            url="https://example.com/blog",
            config=run_cfg
        )

        if result.success:
            print("Cleaned HTML length:", len(result.cleaned_html))
            if result.extracted_content:
                articles = json.loads(result.extracted_content)
                print("Extracted articles:", articles[:2])
        else:
            print("Error:", result.error_message)

asyncio.run(main())
Explanation:

We define a BrowserConfig with Firefox, no headless, and verbose=True. 
We define a CrawlerRunConfig that bypasses cache, uses a CSS extraction schema, has a word_count_threshold=15, etc. 
We pass them to AsyncWebCrawler(config=...) and arun(url=..., config=...).
7. Best Practices & Migration Notes
1. Use BrowserConfig for global settings about the browser’s environment.  2. Use CrawlerRunConfig for per-crawl logic (caching, content filtering, extraction strategies, wait conditions).  3. Avoid legacy parameters like css_selector or word_count_threshold directly in arun(). Instead:

run_cfg = CrawlerRunConfig(css_selector=".main-content", word_count_threshold=20)
result = await crawler.arun(url="...", config=run_cfg)
4. Context Manager usage is simplest unless you want a persistent crawler across many calls.

8. Summary
AsyncWebCrawler is your entry point to asynchronous crawling:

Constructor accepts BrowserConfig (or defaults). 
arun(url, config=CrawlerRunConfig) is the main method for single-page crawls. 
arun_many(urls, config=CrawlerRunConfig) handles concurrency across multiple URLs. 
For advanced lifecycle control, use start() and close() explicitly. 
Migration:

If you used AsyncWebCrawler(browser_type="chromium", css_selector="..."), move browser settings to BrowserConfig(...) and content/crawl logic to CrawlerRunConfig(...).
This modular approach ensures your code is clean, scalable, and easy to maintain. For any advanced or rarely used parameters, see the BrowserConfig docs.
arun() Parameter Guide (New Approach)
In Crawl4AI’s latest configuration model, nearly all parameters that once went directly to arun() are now part of CrawlerRunConfig. When calling arun(), you provide:

await crawler.arun(
    url="https://example.com",  
    config=my_run_config
)
Below is an organized look at the parameters that can go inside CrawlerRunConfig, divided by their functional areas. For Browser settings (e.g., headless, browser_type), see BrowserConfig.

1. Core Usage
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig, CacheMode

async def main():
    run_config = CrawlerRunConfig(
        verbose=True,            # Detailed logging
        cache_mode=CacheMode.ENABLED,  # Use normal read/write cache
        check_robots_txt=True,   # Respect robots.txt rules
        # ... other parameters
    )

    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(
            url="https://example.com",
            config=run_config
        )

        # Check if blocked by robots.txt
        if not result.success and result.status_code == 403:
            print(f"Error: {result.error_message}")
Key Fields: - verbose=True logs each crawl step.  - cache_mode decides how to read/write the local crawl cache.

2. Cache Control
cache_mode (default: CacheMode.ENABLED)
Use a built-in enum from CacheMode:

ENABLED: Normal caching—reads if available, writes if missing.
DISABLED: No caching—always refetch pages.
READ_ONLY: Reads from cache only; no new writes.
WRITE_ONLY: Writes to cache but doesn’t read existing data.
BYPASS: Skips reading cache for this crawl (though it might still write if set up that way).
run_config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS
)
Additional flags:

bypass_cache=True acts like CacheMode.BYPASS.
disable_cache=True acts like CacheMode.DISABLED.
no_cache_read=True acts like CacheMode.WRITE_ONLY.
no_cache_write=True acts like CacheMode.READ_ONLY.
3. Content Processing & Selection
3.1 Text Processing
run_config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    word_count_threshold=10,   # Ignore text blocks <10 words
    only_text=False,           # If True, tries to remove non-text elements
    keep_data_attributes=False # Keep or discard data-* attributes
)
3.2 Content Selection
run_config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    css_selector=".main-content",  # Focus on .main-content region only
    excluded_tags=["form", "nav"], # Remove entire tag blocks
    remove_forms=True,             # Specifically strip <form> elements
    remove_overlay_elements=True,  # Attempt to remove modals/popups
)
3.3 Link Handling
run_config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    exclude_external_links=True,         # Remove external links from final content
    exclude_social_media_links=True,     # Remove links to known social sites
    exclude_domains=["ads.example.com"], # Exclude links to these domains
    exclude_social_media_domains=["facebook.com","twitter.com"], # Extend the default list
)
3.4 Media Filtering
run_config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    exclude_external_images=True  # Strip images from other domains
)
4. Page Navigation & Timing
4.1 Basic Browser Flow
run_config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    wait_for="css:.dynamic-content", # Wait for .dynamic-content
    delay_before_return_html=2.0,    # Wait 2s before capturing final HTML
    page_timeout=60000,             # Navigation & script timeout (ms)
)
Key Fields:

wait_for:
"css:selector" or
"js:() => boolean"
e.g. js:() => document.querySelectorAll('.item').length > 10.

mean_delay & max_range: define random delays for arun_many() calls. 

semaphore_count: concurrency limit when crawling multiple URLs.
4.2 JavaScript Execution
run_config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    js_code=[
        "window.scrollTo(0, document.body.scrollHeight);",
        "document.querySelector('.load-more')?.click();"
    ],
    js_only=False
)
js_code can be a single string or a list of strings. 
js_only=True means “I’m continuing in the same session with new JS steps, no new full navigation.”
4.3 Anti-Bot
run_config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    magic=True,
    simulate_user=True,
    override_navigator=True
)
- magic=True tries multiple stealth features.  - simulate_user=True mimics mouse movements or random delays.  - override_navigator=True fakes some navigator properties (like user agent checks).
5. Session Management
session_id:

run_config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    session_id="my_session123"
)
If re-used in subsequent arun() calls, the same tab/page context is continued (helpful for multi-step tasks or stateful browsing).
6. Screenshot, PDF & Media Options
run_config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    screenshot=True,             # Grab a screenshot as base64
    screenshot_wait_for=1.0,     # Wait 1s before capturing
    pdf=True,                    # Also produce a PDF
    image_description_min_word_threshold=5,  # If analyzing alt text
    image_score_threshold=3,                # Filter out low-score images
)
Where they appear: - result.screenshot → Base64 screenshot string. - result.pdf → Byte array with PDF data.
7. Extraction Strategy
For advanced data extraction (CSS/LLM-based), set extraction_strategy:

run_config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    extraction_strategy=my_css_or_llm_strategy
)
The extracted data will appear in result.extracted_content.

8. Comprehensive Example
Below is a snippet combining many parameters:

import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig, CacheMode
from crawl4ai.extraction_strategy import JsonCssExtractionStrategy

async def main():
    # Example schema
    schema = {
        "name": "Articles",
        "baseSelector": "article.post",
        "fields": [
            {"name": "title", "selector": "h2", "type": "text"},
            {"name": "link",  "selector": "a",  "type": "attribute", "attribute": "href"}
        ]
    }

    run_config = CrawlerRunConfig(
        # Core
        verbose=True,
        cache_mode=CacheMode.ENABLED,
        check_robots_txt=True,   # Respect robots.txt rules

        # Content
        word_count_threshold=10,
        css_selector="main.content",
        excluded_tags=["nav", "footer"],
        exclude_external_links=True,

        # Page & JS
        js_code="document.querySelector('.show-more')?.click();",
        wait_for="css:.loaded-block",
        page_timeout=30000,

        # Extraction
        extraction_strategy=JsonCssExtractionStrategy(schema),

        # Session
        session_id="persistent_session",

        # Media
        screenshot=True,
        pdf=True,

        # Anti-bot
        simulate_user=True,
        magic=True,
    )

    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun("https://example.com/posts", config=run_config)
        if result.success:
            print("HTML length:", len(result.cleaned_html))
            print("Extraction JSON:", result.extracted_content)
            if result.screenshot:
                print("Screenshot length:", len(result.screenshot))
            if result.pdf:
                print("PDF bytes length:", len(result.pdf))
        else:
            print("Error:", result.error_message)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
What we covered:

1. Crawling the main content region, ignoring external links.  2. Running JavaScript to click “.show-more”.  3. Waiting for “.loaded-block” to appear.  4. Generating a screenshot & PDF of the final page.  5. Extracting repeated “article.post” elements with a CSS-based extraction strategy.

9. Best Practices
1. Use BrowserConfig for global browser settings (headless, user agent).  2. Use CrawlerRunConfig to handle the specific crawl needs: content filtering, caching, JS, screenshot, extraction, etc.  3. Keep your parameters consistent in run configs—especially if you’re part of a large codebase with multiple crawls.  4. Limit large concurrency (semaphore_count) if the site or your system can’t handle it.  5. For dynamic pages, set js_code or scan_full_page so you load all content.

10. Conclusion
All parameters that used to be direct arguments to arun() now belong in CrawlerRunConfig. This approach:

Makes code clearer and more maintainable. 
Minimizes confusion about which arguments affect global vs. per-crawl behavior. 
Allows you to create reusable config objects for different pages or tasks.
For a full reference, check out the CrawlerRunConfig Docs. 

Happy crawling with your structured, flexible config approach!

    :param dispatcher: (Optional) A concurrency controller (e.g. MemoryAdaptiveDispatcher).
    ...
    :return: Either a list of `CrawlResult` objects, or an async generator if streaming is enabled.
    """
Differences from arun()
1. Multiple URLs:

Instead of crawling a single URL, you pass a list of them (strings or tasks). 
The function returns either a list of CrawlResult or an async generator if streaming is enabled.
2. Concurrency & Dispatchers:

dispatcher param allows advanced concurrency control. 
If omitted, a default dispatcher (like MemoryAdaptiveDispatcher) is used internally. 
Dispatchers handle concurrency, rate limiting, and memory-based adaptive throttling (see Multi-URL Crawling).
3. Streaming Support:

Enable streaming by setting stream=True in your CrawlerRunConfig.
When streaming, use async for to process results as they become available.
Ideal for processing large numbers of URLs without waiting for all to complete.
4. Parallel Execution**:

arun_many() can run multiple requests concurrently under the hood. 
Each CrawlResult might also include a dispatch_result with concurrency details (like memory usage, start/end times).
Basic Example (Batch Mode)
# Minimal usage: The default dispatcher will be used
results = await crawler.arun_many(
    urls=["https://site1.com", "https://site2.com"],
    config=CrawlerRunConfig(stream=False)  # Default behavior
)

for res in results:
    if res.success:
        print(res.url, "crawled OK!")
    else:
        print("Failed:", res.url, "-", res.error_message)
Streaming Example
config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    stream=True,  # Enable streaming mode
    cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS
)

# Process results as they complete
async for result in await crawler.arun_many(
    urls=["https://site1.com", "https://site2.com", "https://site3.com"],
    config=config
):
    if result.success:
        print(f"Just completed: {result.url}")
        # Process each result immediately
        process_result(result)
With a Custom Dispatcher
dispatcher = MemoryAdaptiveDispatcher(
    memory_threshold_percent=70.0,
    max_session_permit=10
)
results = await crawler.arun_many(
    urls=["https://site1.com", "https://site2.com", "https://site3.com"],
    config=my_run_config,
    dispatcher=dispatcher
)
Key Points: - Each URL is processed by the same or separate sessions, depending on the dispatcher’s strategy. - dispatch_result in each CrawlResult (if using concurrency) can hold memory and timing info.  - If you need to handle authentication or session IDs, pass them in each individual task or within your run config.

Return Value
Either a list of CrawlResult objects, or an async generator if streaming is enabled. You can iterate to check result.success or read each item’s extracted_content, markdown, or dispatch_result.

Dispatcher Reference
MemoryAdaptiveDispatcher: Dynamically manages concurrency based on system memory usage. 
SemaphoreDispatcher: Fixed concurrency limit, simpler but less adaptive. 
For advanced usage or custom settings, see Multi-URL Crawling with Dispatchers.

Common Pitfalls
1. Large Lists: If you pass thousands of URLs, be mindful of memory or rate-limits. A dispatcher can help. 

2. Session Reuse: If you need specialized logins or persistent contexts, ensure your dispatcher or tasks handle sessions accordingly. 

3. Error Handling: Each CrawlResult might fail for different reasons—always check result.success or the error_message before proceeding.

Conclusion
Use arun_many() when you want to crawl multiple URLs simultaneously or in controlled parallel tasks. If you need advanced concurrency features (like memory-based adaptive throttling or complex rate-limiting), provide a dispatcher. Each result is a standard CrawlResult, possibly augmented with concurrency stats (dispatch_result) for deeper inspection. For more details on concurrency logic and dispatchers, see the Advanced Multi-URL Crawling docs.

1. BrowserConfig – Controlling the Browser
BrowserConfig focuses on how the browser is launched and behaves. This includes headless mode, proxies, user agents, and other environment tweaks.

from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, BrowserConfig

browser_cfg = BrowserConfig(
    browser_type="chromium",
    headless=True,
    viewport_width=1280,
    viewport_height=720,
    proxy="http://user:pass@proxy:8080",
    user_agent="Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 Chrome/116.0.0.0 Safari/537.36",
)
1.1 Parameter Highlights
Parameter	Type / Default	What It Does
browser_type	"chromium", "firefox", "webkit"
(default: "chromium")	Which browser engine to use. "chromium" is typical for many sites, "firefox" or "webkit" for specialized tests.
headless	bool (default: True)	Headless means no visible UI. False is handy for debugging.
viewport_width	int (default: 1080)	Initial page width (in px). Useful for testing responsive layouts.
viewport_height	int (default: 600)	Initial page height (in px).
proxy	str (default: None)	Single-proxy URL if you want all traffic to go through it, e.g. "http://user:pass@proxy:8080".
proxy_config	dict (default: None)	For advanced or multi-proxy needs, specify details like {"server": "...", "username": "...", ...}.
use_persistent_context	bool (default: False)	If True, uses a persistent browser context (keep cookies, sessions across runs). Also sets use_managed_browser=True.
user_data_dir	str or None (default: None)	Directory to store user data (profiles, cookies). Must be set if you want permanent sessions.
ignore_https_errors	bool (default: True)	If True, continues despite invalid certificates (common in dev/staging).
java_script_enabled	bool (default: True)	Disable if you want no JS overhead, or if only static content is needed.
cookies	list (default: [])	Pre-set cookies, each a dict like {"name": "session", "value": "...", "url": "..."}.
headers	dict (default: {})	Extra HTTP headers for every request, e.g. {"Accept-Language": "en-US"}.
user_agent	str (default: Chrome-based UA)	Your custom or random user agent. user_agent_mode="random" can shuffle it.
light_mode	bool (default: False)	Disables some background features for performance gains.
text_mode	bool (default: False)	If True, tries to disable images/other heavy content for speed.
use_managed_browser	bool (default: False)	For advanced “managed” interactions (debugging, CDP usage). Typically set automatically if persistent context is on.
extra_args	list (default: [])	Additional flags for the underlying browser process, e.g. ["--disable-extensions"].
Tips: - Set headless=False to visually debug how pages load or how interactions proceed.
- If you need authentication storage or repeated sessions, consider use_persistent_context=True and specify user_data_dir.
- For large pages, you might need a bigger viewport_width and viewport_height to handle dynamic content.

2. CrawlerRunConfig – Controlling Each Crawl
While BrowserConfig sets up the environment, CrawlerRunConfig details how each crawl operation should behave: caching, content filtering, link or domain blocking, timeouts, JavaScript code, etc.

from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig

run_cfg = CrawlerRunConfig(
    wait_for="css:.main-content",
    word_count_threshold=15,
    excluded_tags=["nav", "footer"],
    exclude_external_links=True,
    stream=True,  # Enable streaming for arun_many()
)
2.1 Parameter Highlights
We group them by category.

A) Content Processing
Parameter	Type / Default	What It Does
word_count_threshold	int (default: ~200)	Skips text blocks below X words. Helps ignore trivial sections.
extraction_strategy	ExtractionStrategy (default: None)	If set, extracts structured data (CSS-based, LLM-based, etc.).
markdown_generator	MarkdownGenerationStrategy (None)	If you want specialized markdown output (citations, filtering, chunking, etc.).
content_filter	RelevantContentFilter (None)	Filters out irrelevant text blocks. E.g., PruningContentFilter or BM25ContentFilter.
css_selector	str (None)	Retains only the part of the page matching this selector.
excluded_tags	list (None)	Removes entire tags (e.g. ["script", "style"]).
excluded_selector	str (None)	Like css_selector but to exclude. E.g. "#ads, .tracker".
only_text	bool (False)	If True, tries to extract text-only content.
prettiify	bool (False)	If True, beautifies final HTML (slower, purely cosmetic).
keep_data_attributes	bool (False)	If True, preserve data-* attributes in cleaned HTML.
remove_forms	bool (False)	If True, remove all <form> elements.
B) Caching & Session
Parameter	Type / Default	What It Does
cache_mode	CacheMode or None	Controls how caching is handled (ENABLED, BYPASS, DISABLED, etc.). If None, typically defaults to ENABLED.
session_id	str or None	Assign a unique ID to reuse a single browser session across multiple arun() calls.
bypass_cache	bool (False)	If True, acts like CacheMode.BYPASS.
disable_cache	bool (False)	If True, acts like CacheMode.DISABLED.
no_cache_read	bool (False)	If True, acts like CacheMode.WRITE_ONLY (writes cache but never reads).
no_cache_write	bool (False)	If True, acts like CacheMode.READ_ONLY (reads cache but never writes).
Use these for controlling whether you read or write from a local content cache. Handy for large batch crawls or repeated site visits.

C) Page Navigation & Timing
Parameter	Type / Default	What It Does
wait_until	str (domcontentloaded)	Condition for navigation to “complete”. Often "networkidle" or "domcontentloaded".
page_timeout	int (60000 ms)	Timeout for page navigation or JS steps. Increase for slow sites.
wait_for	str or None	Wait for a CSS ("css:selector") or JS ("js:() => bool") condition before content extraction.
wait_for_images	bool (False)	Wait for images to load before finishing. Slows down if you only want text.
delay_before_return_html	float (0.1)	Additional pause (seconds) before final HTML is captured. Good for last-second updates.
check_robots_txt	bool (False)	Whether to check and respect robots.txt rules before crawling. If True, caches robots.txt for efficiency.
mean_delay and max_range	float (0.1, 0.3)	If you call arun_many(), these define random delay intervals between crawls, helping avoid detection or rate limits.
semaphore_count	int (5)	Max concurrency for arun_many(). Increase if you have resources for parallel crawls.
D) Page Interaction
Parameter	Type / Default	What It Does
js_code	str or list[str] (None)	JavaScript to run after load. E.g. "document.querySelector('button')?.click();".
js_only	bool (False)	If True, indicates we’re reusing an existing session and only applying JS. No full reload.
ignore_body_visibility	bool (True)	Skip checking if <body> is visible. Usually best to keep True.
scan_full_page	bool (False)	If True, auto-scroll the page to load dynamic content (infinite scroll).
scroll_delay	float (0.2)	Delay between scroll steps if scan_full_page=True.
process_iframes	bool (False)	Inlines iframe content for single-page extraction.
remove_overlay_elements	bool (False)	Removes potential modals/popups blocking the main content.
simulate_user	bool (False)	Simulate user interactions (mouse movements) to avoid bot detection.
override_navigator	bool (False)	Override navigator properties in JS for stealth.
magic	bool (False)	Automatic handling of popups/consent banners. Experimental.
adjust_viewport_to_content	bool (False)	Resizes viewport to match page content height.
If your page is a single-page app with repeated JS updates, set js_only=True in subsequent calls, plus a session_id for reusing the same tab.

E) Media Handling
Parameter	Type / Default	What It Does
screenshot	bool (False)	Capture a screenshot (base64) in result.screenshot.
screenshot_wait_for	float or None	Extra wait time before the screenshot.
screenshot_height_threshold	int (~20000)	If the page is taller than this, alternate screenshot strategies are used.
pdf	bool (False)	If True, returns a PDF in result.pdf.
image_description_min_word_threshold	int (~50)	Minimum words for an image’s alt text or description to be considered valid.
image_score_threshold	int (~3)	Filter out low-scoring images. The crawler scores images by relevance (size, context, etc.).
exclude_external_images	bool (False)	Exclude images from other domains.
F) Link/Domain Handling
Parameter	Type / Default	What It Does
exclude_social_media_domains	list (e.g. Facebook/Twitter)	A default list can be extended. Any link to these domains is removed from final output.
exclude_external_links	bool (False)	Removes all links pointing outside the current domain.
exclude_social_media_links	bool (False)	Strips links specifically to social sites (like Facebook or Twitter).
exclude_domains	list ([])	Provide a custom list of domains to exclude (like ["ads.com", "trackers.io"]).
Use these for link-level content filtering (often to keep crawls “internal” or to remove spammy domains).

G) Rate Limiting & Resource Management
Parameter	Type / Default	What It Does
enable_rate_limiting	bool (default: False)	Enable intelligent rate limiting for multiple URLs
rate_limit_config	RateLimitConfig (default: None)	Configuration for rate limiting behavior
The RateLimitConfig class has these fields:

Field	Type / Default	What It Does
base_delay	Tuple[float, float] (1.0, 3.0)	Random delay range between requests to the same domain
max_delay	float (60.0)	Maximum delay after rate limit detection
max_retries	int (3)	Number of retries before giving up on rate-limited requests
rate_limit_codes	List[int] ([429, 503])	HTTP status codes that trigger rate limiting behavior
Parameter	Type / Default	What It Does
memory_threshold_percent	float (70.0)	Maximum memory usage before pausing new crawls
check_interval	float (1.0)	How often to check system resources (in seconds)
max_session_permit	int (20)	Maximum number of concurrent crawl sessions
display_mode	str (None, "DETAILED", "AGGREGATED")	How to display progress information
H) Debug & Logging
Parameter	Type / Default	What It Does
verbose	bool (True)	Prints logs detailing each step of crawling, interactions, or errors.
log_console	bool (False)	Logs the page’s JavaScript console output if you want deeper JS debugging.
2.2 Helper Methods
Both BrowserConfig and CrawlerRunConfig provide a clone() method to create modified copies:

# Create a base configuration
base_config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    cache_mode=CacheMode.ENABLED,
    word_count_threshold=200
)

# Create variations using clone()
stream_config = base_config.clone(stream=True)
no_cache_config = base_config.clone(
    cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS,
    stream=True
)
The clone() method is particularly useful when you need slightly different configurations for different use cases, without modifying the original config.

2.3 Example Usage
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, BrowserConfig, CrawlerRunConfig, CacheMode, RateLimitConfig

async def main():
    # Configure the browser
    browser_cfg = BrowserConfig(
        headless=False,
        viewport_width=1280,
        viewport_height=720,
        proxy="http://user:pass@myproxy:8080",
        text_mode=True
    )

    # Configure the run
    run_cfg = CrawlerRunConfig(
        cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS,
        session_id="my_session",
        css_selector="main.article",
        excluded_tags=["script", "style"],
        exclude_external_links=True,
        wait_for="css:.article-loaded",
        screenshot=True,
        enable_rate_limiting=True,
        rate_limit_config=RateLimitConfig(
            base_delay=(1.0, 3.0),
            max_delay=60.0,
            max_retries=3,
            rate_limit_codes=[429, 503]
        ),
        memory_threshold_percent=70.0,
        check_interval=1.0,
        max_session_permit=20,
        display_mode="DETAILED",
        stream=True
    )

    async with AsyncWebCrawler(config=browser_cfg) as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(
            url="https://example.com/news",
            config=run_cfg
        )
        if result.success:
            print("Final cleaned_html length:", len(result.cleaned_html))
            if result.screenshot:
                print("Screenshot captured (base64, length):", len(result.screenshot))
        else:
            print("Crawl failed:", result.error_message)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())

## 2.4 Compliance & Ethics

| **Parameter**          | **Type / Default**      | **What It Does**                                                                                                    |
|-----------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **`check_robots_txt`**| `bool` (False)          | When True, checks and respects robots.txt rules before crawling. Uses efficient caching with SQLite backend.          |
| **`user_agent`**      | `str` (None)            | User agent string to identify your crawler. Used for robots.txt checking when enabled.                                |

```python
run_config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    check_robots_txt=True,  # Enable robots.txt compliance
    user_agent="MyBot/1.0"  # Identify your crawler
)
3. Putting It All Together
Use BrowserConfig for global browser settings: engine, headless, proxy, user agent.
Use CrawlerRunConfig for each crawl’s context: how to filter content, handle caching, wait for dynamic elements, or run JS.
Pass both configs to AsyncWebCrawler (the BrowserConfig) and then to arun() (the CrawlerRunConfig).
# Create a modified copy with the clone() method
stream_cfg = run_cfg.clone(
    stream=True,
    cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS
)

CrawlResult Reference
The CrawlResult class encapsulates everything returned after a single crawl operation. It provides the raw or processed content, details on links and media, plus optional metadata (like screenshots, PDFs, or extracted JSON).

Location: crawl4ai/crawler/models.py (for reference)

class CrawlResult(BaseModel):
    url: str
    html: str
    success: bool
    cleaned_html: Optional[str] = None
    media: Dict[str, List[Dict]] = {}
    links: Dict[str, List[Dict]] = {}
    downloaded_files: Optional[List[str]] = None
    screenshot: Optional[str] = None
    pdf : Optional[bytes] = None
    markdown: Optional[Union[str, MarkdownGenerationResult]] = None
    markdown_v2: Optional[MarkdownGenerationResult] = None
    fit_markdown: Optional[str] = None
    fit_html: Optional[str] = None
    extracted_content: Optional[str] = None
    metadata: Optional[dict] = None
    error_message: Optional[str] = None
    session_id: Optional[str] = None
    response_headers: Optional[dict] = None
    status_code: Optional[int] = None
    ssl_certificate: Optional[SSLCertificate] = None
    dispatch_result: Optional[DispatchResult] = None
    ...
Below is a field-by-field explanation and possible usage patterns.

1. Basic Crawl Info
1.1 url (str)
What: The final crawled URL (after any redirects).
Usage:

print(result.url)  # e.g., "https://example.com/"
1.2 success (bool)
What: True if the crawl pipeline ended without major errors; False otherwise.
Usage:

if not result.success:
    print(f"Crawl failed: {result.error_message}")
1.3 status_code (Optional[int])
What: The page’s HTTP status code (e.g., 200, 404).
Usage:

if result.status_code == 404:
    print("Page not found!")
1.4 error_message (Optional[str])
What: If success=False, a textual description of the failure.
Usage:

if not result.success:
    print("Error:", result.error_message)
1.5 session_id (Optional[str])
What: The ID used for reusing a browser context across multiple calls.
Usage:

# If you used session_id="login_session" in CrawlerRunConfig, see it here:
print("Session:", result.session_id)
1.6 response_headers (Optional[dict])
What: Final HTTP response headers.
Usage:

if result.response_headers:
    print("Server:", result.response_headers.get("Server", "Unknown"))
1.7 ssl_certificate (Optional[SSLCertificate])
What: If fetch_ssl_certificate=True in your CrawlerRunConfig, result.ssl_certificate contains a SSLCertificate object describing the site’s certificate. You can export the cert in multiple formats (PEM/DER/JSON) or access its properties like issuer, subject, valid_from, valid_until, etc. Usage:

if result.ssl_certificate:
    print("Issuer:", result.ssl_certificate.issuer)
2. Raw / Cleaned Content
2.1 html (str)
What: The original unmodified HTML from the final page load.
Usage:

# Possibly large
print(len(result.html))
2.2 cleaned_html (Optional[str])
What: A sanitized HTML version—scripts, styles, or excluded tags are removed based on your CrawlerRunConfig.
Usage:

print(result.cleaned_html[:500])  # Show a snippet
2.3 fit_html (Optional[str])
What: If a content filter or heuristic (e.g., Pruning/BM25) modifies the HTML, the “fit” or post-filter version.
When: This is only present if your markdown_generator or content_filter produces it.
Usage:

if result.fit_html:
    print("High-value HTML content:", result.fit_html[:300])
3. Markdown Fields
3.1 The Markdown Generation Approach
Crawl4AI can convert HTML→Markdown, optionally including:

Raw markdown
Links as citations (with a references section)
Fit markdown if a content filter is used (like Pruning or BM25)
3.2 markdown_v2 (Optional[MarkdownGenerationResult])
What: The structured object holding multiple markdown variants. Soon to be consolidated into markdown.

MarkdownGenerationResult includes: - raw_markdown (str): The full HTML→Markdown conversion.
- markdown_with_citations (str): Same markdown, but with link references as academic-style citations.
- references_markdown (str): The reference list or footnotes at the end.
- fit_markdown (Optional[str]): If content filtering (Pruning/BM25) was applied, the filtered “fit” text.
- fit_html (Optional[str]): The HTML that led to fit_markdown.

Usage:

if result.markdown_v2:
    md_res = result.markdown_v2
    print("Raw MD:", md_res.raw_markdown[:300])
    print("Citations MD:", md_res.markdown_with_citations[:300])
    print("References:", md_res.references_markdown)
    if md_res.fit_markdown:
        print("Pruned text:", md_res.fit_markdown[:300])
3.3 markdown (Optional[Union[str, MarkdownGenerationResult]])
What: In future versions, markdown will fully replace markdown_v2. Right now, it might be a str or a MarkdownGenerationResult.
Usage:

# Soon, you might see:
if isinstance(result.markdown, MarkdownGenerationResult):
    print(result.markdown.raw_markdown[:200])
else:
    print(result.markdown)
3.4 fit_markdown (Optional[str])
What: A direct reference to the final filtered markdown (legacy approach).
When: This is set if a filter or content strategy explicitly writes there. Usually overshadowed by markdown_v2.fit_markdown.
Usage:

print(result.fit_markdown)  # Legacy field, prefer result.markdown_v2.fit_markdown
Important: “Fit” content (in fit_markdown/fit_html) only exists if you used a filter (like PruningContentFilter or BM25ContentFilter) within a MarkdownGenerationStrategy.

4. Media & Links
4.1 media (Dict[str, List[Dict]])
What: Contains info about discovered images, videos, or audio. Typically keys: "images", "videos", "audios".
Common Fields in each item:

src (str): Media URL
alt or title (str): Descriptive text
score (float): Relevance score if the crawler’s heuristic found it “important”
desc or description (Optional[str]): Additional context extracted from surrounding text
Usage:

images = result.media.get("images", [])
for img in images:
    if img.get("score", 0) > 5:
        print("High-value image:", img["src"])
4.2 links (Dict[str, List[Dict]])
What: Holds internal and external link data. Usually two keys: "internal" and "external".
Common Fields:

href (str): The link target
text (str): Link text
title (str): Title attribute
context (str): Surrounding text snippet
domain (str): If external, the domain
Usage:

for link in result.links["internal"]:
    print(f"Internal link to {link['href']} with text {link['text']}")
5. Additional Fields
5.1 extracted_content (Optional[str])
What: If you used extraction_strategy (CSS, LLM, etc.), the structured output (JSON).
Usage:

if result.extracted_content:
    data = json.loads(result.extracted_content)
    print(data)
5.2 downloaded_files (Optional[List[str]])
What: If accept_downloads=True in your BrowserConfig + downloads_path, lists local file paths for downloaded items.
Usage:

if result.downloaded_files:
    for file_path in result.downloaded_files:
        print("Downloaded:", file_path)
5.3 screenshot (Optional[str])
What: Base64-encoded screenshot if screenshot=True in CrawlerRunConfig.
Usage:

import base64
if result.screenshot:
    with open("page.png", "wb") as f:
        f.write(base64.b64decode(result.screenshot))
5.4 pdf (Optional[bytes])
What: Raw PDF bytes if pdf=True in CrawlerRunConfig.
Usage:

if result.pdf:
    with open("page.pdf", "wb") as f:
        f.write(result.pdf)
5.5 metadata (Optional[dict])
What: Page-level metadata if discovered (title, description, OG data, etc.).
Usage:

if result.metadata:
    print("Title:", result.metadata.get("title"))
    print("Author:", result.metadata.get("author"))
6. dispatch_result (optional)
A DispatchResult object providing additional concurrency and resource usage information when crawling URLs in parallel (e.g., via arun_many() with custom dispatchers). It contains:

task_id: A unique identifier for the parallel task.
memory_usage (float): The memory (in MB) used at the time of completion.
peak_memory (float): The peak memory usage (in MB) recorded during the task’s execution.
start_time / end_time (datetime): Time range for this crawling task.
error_message (str): Any dispatcher- or concurrency-related error encountered.
# Example usage:
for result in results:
    if result.success and result.dispatch_result:
        dr = result.dispatch_result
        print(f"URL: {result.url}, Task ID: {dr.task_id}")
        print(f"Memory: {dr.memory_usage:.1f} MB (Peak: {dr.peak_memory:.1f} MB)")
        print(f"Duration: {dr.end_time - dr.start_time}")
Note: This field is typically populated when using arun_many(...) alongside a dispatcher (e.g., MemoryAdaptiveDispatcher or SemaphoreDispatcher). If no concurrency or dispatcher is used, dispatch_result may remain None.

7. Example: Accessing Everything
async def handle_result(result: CrawlResult):
    if not result.success:
        print("Crawl error:", result.error_message)
        return

    # Basic info
    print("Crawled URL:", result.url)
    print("Status code:", result.status_code)

    # HTML
    print("Original HTML size:", len(result.html))
    print("Cleaned HTML size:", len(result.cleaned_html or ""))

    # Markdown output
    if result.markdown_v2:
        print("Raw Markdown:", result.markdown_v2.raw_markdown[:300])
        print("Citations Markdown:", result.markdown_v2.markdown_with_citations[:300])
        if result.markdown_v2.fit_markdown:
            print("Fit Markdown:", result.markdown_v2.fit_markdown[:200])
    else:
        print("Raw Markdown (legacy):", result.markdown[:200] if result.markdown else "N/A")

    # Media & Links
    if "images" in result.media:
        print("Image count:", len(result.media["images"]))
    if "internal" in result.links:
        print("Internal link count:", len(result.links["internal"]))

    # Extraction strategy result
    if result.extracted_content:
        print("Structured data:", result.extracted_content)

    # Screenshot/PDF
    if result.screenshot:
        print("Screenshot length:", len(result.screenshot))
    if result.pdf:
        print("PDF bytes length:", len(result.pdf))
8. Key Points & Future
1. markdown_v2 vs markdown
- Right now, markdown_v2 is the more robust container (MarkdownGenerationResult), providing raw_markdown, markdown_with_citations, references, plus possible fit_markdown.
- In future versions, everything will unify under markdown. If you rely on advanced features (citations, fit content), check markdown_v2.

2. Fit Content
- fit_markdown and fit_html appear only if you used a content filter (like PruningContentFilter or BM25ContentFilter) inside your MarkdownGenerationStrategy or set them directly.
- If no filter is used, they remain None.

3. References & Citations
- If you enable link citations in your DefaultMarkdownGenerator (options={"citations": True}), you’ll see markdown_with_citations plus a references_markdown block. This helps large language models or academic-like referencing.

4. Links & Media
- links["internal"] and links["external"] group discovered anchors by domain.
- media["images"] / ["videos"] / ["audios"] store extracted media elements with optional scoring or context.

5. Error Cases
- If success=False, check error_message (e.g., timeouts, invalid URLs).
- status_code might be None if we failed before an HTTP response.

Use CrawlResult to glean all final outputs and feed them into your data pipelines, AI models, or archives. With the synergy of a properly configured BrowserConfig and CrawlerRunConfig, the crawler can produce robust, structured results here in CrawlResult.

Extraction & Chunking Strategies API
This documentation covers the API reference for extraction and chunking strategies in Crawl4AI.

Extraction Strategies
All extraction strategies inherit from the base ExtractionStrategy class and implement two key methods: - extract(url: str, html: str) -> List[Dict[str, Any]] - run(url: str, sections: List[str]) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]

LLMExtractionStrategy
Used for extracting structured data using Language Models.

LLMExtractionStrategy(
    # Required Parameters
    provider: str = DEFAULT_PROVIDER,     # LLM provider (e.g., "ollama/llama2")
    api_token: Optional[str] = None,      # API token

    # Extraction Configuration
    instruction: str = None,              # Custom extraction instruction
    schema: Dict = None,                  # Pydantic model schema for structured data
    extraction_type: str = "block",       # "block" or "schema"

    # Chunking Parameters
    chunk_token_threshold: int = 4000,    # Maximum tokens per chunk
    overlap_rate: float = 0.1,           # Overlap between chunks
    word_token_rate: float = 0.75,       # Word to token conversion rate
    apply_chunking: bool = True,         # Enable/disable chunking

    # API Configuration
    base_url: str = None,                # Base URL for API
    extra_args: Dict = {},               # Additional provider arguments
    verbose: bool = False                # Enable verbose logging
)
CosineStrategy
Used for content similarity-based extraction and clustering.

CosineStrategy(
    # Content Filtering
    semantic_filter: str = None,        # Topic/keyword filter
    word_count_threshold: int = 10,     # Minimum words per cluster
    sim_threshold: float = 0.3,         # Similarity threshold

    # Clustering Parameters
    max_dist: float = 0.2,             # Maximum cluster distance
    linkage_method: str = 'ward',       # Clustering method
    top_k: int = 3,                    # Top clusters to return

    # Model Configuration
    model_name: str = 'sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2',  # Embedding model

    verbose: bool = False              # Enable verbose logging
)
JsonCssExtractionStrategy
Used for CSS selector-based structured data extraction.

JsonCssExtractionStrategy(
    schema: Dict[str, Any],    # Extraction schema
    verbose: bool = False      # Enable verbose logging
)

# Schema Structure
schema = {
    "name": str,              # Schema name
    "baseSelector": str,      # Base CSS selector
    "fields": [               # List of fields to extract
        {
            "name": str,      # Field name
            "selector": str,  # CSS selector
            "type": str,     # Field type: "text", "attribute", "html", "regex"
            "attribute": str, # For type="attribute"
            "pattern": str,  # For type="regex"
            "transform": str, # Optional: "lowercase", "uppercase", "strip"
            "default": Any    # Default value if extraction fails
        }
    ]
}
Chunking Strategies
All chunking strategies inherit from ChunkingStrategy and implement the chunk(text: str) -> list method.

RegexChunking
Splits text based on regex patterns.

RegexChunking(
    patterns: List[str] = None  # Regex patterns for splitting
                               # Default: [r'\n\n']
)
SlidingWindowChunking
Creates overlapping chunks with a sliding window approach.

SlidingWindowChunking(
    window_size: int = 100,    # Window size in words
    step: int = 50             # Step size between windows
)
OverlappingWindowChunking
Creates chunks with specified overlap.

OverlappingWindowChunking(
    window_size: int = 1000,   # Chunk size in words
    overlap: int = 100         # Overlap size in words
)
Usage Examples
LLM Extraction
from pydantic import BaseModel
from crawl4ai.extraction_strategy import LLMExtractionStrategy

# Define schema
class Article(BaseModel):
    title: str
    content: str
    author: str

# Create strategy
strategy = LLMExtractionStrategy(
    provider="ollama/llama2",
    schema=Article.schema(),
    instruction="Extract article details"
)

# Use with crawler
result = await crawler.arun(
    url="https://example.com/article",
    extraction_strategy=strategy
)

# Access extracted data
data = json.loads(result.extracted_content)
CSS Extraction
from crawl4ai.extraction_strategy import JsonCssExtractionStrategy

# Define schema
schema = {
    "name": "Product List",
    "baseSelector": ".product-card",
    "fields": [
        {
            "name": "title",
            "selector": "h2.title",
            "type": "text"
        },
        {
            "name": "price",
            "selector": ".price",
            "type": "text",
            "transform": "strip"
        },
        {
            "name": "image",
            "selector": "img",
            "type": "attribute",
            "attribute": "src"
        }
    ]
}

# Create and use strategy
strategy = JsonCssExtractionStrategy(schema)
result = await crawler.arun(
    url="https://example.com/products",
    extraction_strategy=strategy
)
Content Chunking
from crawl4ai.chunking_strategy import OverlappingWindowChunking

# Create chunking strategy
chunker = OverlappingWindowChunking(
    window_size=500,  # 500 words per chunk
    overlap=50        # 50 words overlap
)

# Use with extraction strategy
strategy = LLMExtractionStrategy(
    provider="ollama/llama2",
    chunking_strategy=chunker
)

result = await crawler.arun(
    url="https://example.com/long-article",
    extraction_strategy=strategy
)
Best Practices
1. Choose the Right Strategy - Use LLMExtractionStrategy for complex, unstructured content - Use JsonCssExtractionStrategy for well-structured HTML - Use CosineStrategy for content similarity and clustering

2. Optimize Chunking

# For long documents
strategy = LLMExtractionStrategy(
    chunk_token_threshold=2000,  # Smaller chunks
    overlap_rate=0.1           # 10% overlap
)
3. Handle Errors

try:
    result = await crawler.arun(
        url="https://example.com",
        extraction_strategy=strategy
    )
    if result.success:
        content = json.loads(result.extracted_content)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Extraction failed: {e}")
4. Monitor Performance

strategy = CosineStrategy(
    verbose=True,  # Enable logging
    word_count_threshold=20,  # Filter short content
    top_k=5  # Limit results
)
